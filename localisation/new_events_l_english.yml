Many support these actions though, most notably being East Germany's Führer saying that the Protectorate was only trying to maintain its cohesion in a rapidly developing world, other alleged supporters is the current President of Russia who has been known as a fervent anti-monarchist, sourcing that it ruins nations and using Russian history as an example.\nCould this mark the end of the Protectorate?"

This shows a turn in the global scale, with Maratha quickly moving the recognise the new government and a sign of the old ideals of global Maletism.\nThis is a dark day for Brandenburg."
