 #martial law in great britain
 newsWN.4.t:0 "Martial Law in Britain"
 newsWN.4.desc:0 "In response to the increasing amount of anti-government protests in the Commonwealth, the government has officially declared martial law in the country - reasoning that they're in a state of crisis due to the rise of 'Royalist terrorism.'\nMany were quick to criticise the harshness of government actions, by saying that they're barbaric and suppressing a basic human right. Many support these actions though, most notably being East Germany's Führer saying that the Protectorate was only trying to maintain its cohesion in a rapidly developing world, other alleged supporters is the current President of Russia who has been known as a fervent anti-monarchist, sourcing that it ruins nations and using Russian history as an example.\nCould this mark the end of the Protectorate?"

 newsWN.4.b:0 "Hah! We're still stronger than them!"
 newsWN.4.c:0 "Deny it fervently in public."

 newsWN.5.desc:0 "Due to the wealthy nature of the continent, Maletism has largely struggled to make a stronghold in Europe besides fringe parties. Today this changes, only hours ago the parliament of Brandenburg was stormed and overthrown by Thälmann and a relatively large amount of supporters. Many governments are now really worried about the possibilities of a Maletist coup in their own country with crack downs on major parties issued in some.\nThe new government of Brandenburg has rapidly changed the country already, with many gigantic business assets being seized within the first few hours of the Maletists seizing power. This shows a turn in the global scale, with Maratha quickly moving the recognise the new government and a sign of the old ideals of global Maletism.\nThis is a dark day for Brandenburg."

 #'fall of the duumvirate'
 newsWN.6.t:0 "'Fall of the Duumvirate'"
 newsWN.6.desc:0 "Due to the Protectorate's state of internal dissent and instability, the government of Sweden has officially suspended the Duumvirate alliance 'until further notice,' according to Swedish King Gustaf V, whilst the population of Sweden had a mostly popular opinion towards this decision in the Protectorate a lot of people saw it as 'betrayal' and proof that they should be ready for any threat, others simply see it as a wise move as it becomes clearer and clearer that the Commonwealth is on the brink of collapse and civil war.\nLord-Protector Ironside has announced in a public statement that he understands the frustrations and motives of Sweden but doesn't understand why they would take such a seemingly suicidal decision with Sweden having disputed claims with Russia.\nSweden hasn't issued a response to his speech yet."
