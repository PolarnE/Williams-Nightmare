 h1936_mexico.1.d:0 "The civil war that has ravaged Mexico since the 28th of September 1935 has officially come to an end with the legitimate government of President Calles triumphing over the Synarchist and Constitutionalist rebels, forever enshrining President Calles as a hero of the people and the saviour of the Mexican nation.\n\nWinning the civil war isn't the full battle though, a large amount of Mexico has been left in ruin from the large-scale fighting that consumed the Mexican countryside and quite a lot of the cities. The next few years will be the most trying times in Mexican history outside of the Independence War which overthrow Joseph Bonaparte over a century ago, this is still certainly a better outcome than Mexico being fully conquered by one of the rebel factions and the future being lead by a terrorist government - of course."

 h1936_mexico.3.d:0 "The destructive civil war has finally come to an end! The ideals of democracy, liberty and freedom have overpowered the evil tyranny and authoritarianism of both the Calles government and the Synarchists. Founding a democratic government from the ashes of the Calles dictatorship will be a tough challenge but we will continue the battle until the bitter end, for the foreseeable future we will be rebuilding Mexico and securing our position internationally - especially with potentially friendly nations like Russia."
