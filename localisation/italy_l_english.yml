 h1936_italy.1.d:0 "With the chaos engulfing the French Empire, Balbo and his group of influental generals, admirals and politicians have finally begun the long anticipated coup attempt. Initially it seemed like the attempt would be a failure due to what seemed like low popular support for a military junta leading Italy - but still the soldiers pushed on and eventually managed to overpower the few garrisons and Imperial Guard that were defending government buildings.\nAfter entering the Italian Parliament, Admiral Bergamini made a speech announcing the dissolution of Parliament and that all powers would be handed over to Balbo, de facto dissolving the monarchy in Italy and withdrawing them from the Entente Impérial."

 h1936_italy.2.d:0 ""Italy has been freed from its century long oppression by France, Italians shall no longer bow down to a malevolent Frenchman claiming to be the successor to Napoleon. We shall now choose our own fate without the interference of any other power - Italy will be returned to its once prestigious state that it lost in the Napoleonic Wars," or so goes the speech made by Italo Balbo announcing the end of the Kingdom of Italy and the establishment of the Republic of Italy. Balbo is no longer a supposed Regent for the true head of state, now he is the President of Italy."
