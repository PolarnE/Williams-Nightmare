 austria.5.d:0 "It's hard to believe that the Habsburg dynasty in charge of the Adriatic Federation was once at the helms of one of the greatest Empires in the world, the shambling remains of what they once had is the Adriatic Federation, which in itself seems to have a limited lifespan.\nDuring the Middle Ages and Early Modern period the Habsburgs slowly built a continental empire to rival some of the mightiest nations the continent has ever seen - Austria had an uphill battle in its earlier history, having to contend with the likes of the powerful Ottoman Empire, the unconquerable France and the lumbering Poland-Lithuania. The Austrian rise to greatness started with the Habsburg dynasty becoming the Emperor of the Germany and Italy, overtime, early threats to Austria like Bohemia and Hungary were forced under direct Habsburg rule after their dynasties died. Bohemia and Hungary's ascension into the Austrian realm put them in direct competition with the quickly growing Ottoman Empire, with most European nations not caring much for the growing Turkish menace more and more of the Austrian realm fell under Turkish rule. However, after the disastrous Siege of Vienna turned all attention to the Ottomans they were forced to face a coalition that completely demolished the stagnating empire - with the Ottomans entering a permanent decline as a result of this Austria only had more enemies to contend with, unlike her European adversaries Austria never made any serious attempts for colonisation of the New World which in the long run only left Austria weaker than all of her enemies."

 austria.6.d:0 "By the 1700s the rule of the Habsburgs only got more and more questionable, dangerous ideas like the Enlightenment threatened to destroy the old absolute monarchies of the continent, with large multiethnic empires like Austria seeming almost doomed to collapse with the rise of extreme ideas like nationstates and nationalism. Europe became a ticking timebomb with everyone waiting for who would be the first empire to collapse to these radical ideas, after the Seven Years War completely devastated the French economy they fell into complete anarchy with this new French Republic ending up at war with almost all of Europe but still succeeding due to general Napoleon the Great seizing power of France. After several wars with Napoleon's emerging power France became the strongest nation on earth with nobody able to contend with them, until his death in 1821 Europe was under the absolute rule of the French and Russian Empires with Austria being left a humiliated rump state that was virtually a condominium of the two superpowers.\nThe situation only got worse after Napoleon's death though, in 1848 the Great Hungarian Revolution ended in a complete failure for the Empire, seeing over half of its territories lost they were forced to reform to even have a chance of surviving with mixed results.\nAustria is still a declining power, with the once great glory it held being only a figment of the long gone past. In recent history, things do not look good for the newly formed Adriatic Federation, political infighting has become so common that the government and country is being torn apart, radical ideas such as Gosterism and Maletism are taking hold of the nation and for the foreseeable future the coutry is completely paralysed."
