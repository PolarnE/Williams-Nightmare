 ########################events
 commonwealth.1.t:0 "Economic Depression Hits the Protectorate"
 commonwealth.1.d:0 "We've been trading heavily with France for quite a while due to their empire containing lots of valuable resources, this has came to hit us hard as the recent depression in France has severely damaged our economy.\nStocks are plummeting rapidly with it still decreasing right now, many in the cabinet are worried about the future of the country as it seems more and more likely that a popular revolt could be staged that might risk even overthrowing the Lord-Protector system."
 commonwealth.1.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 commonwealth.2.t:0 "Anti-Government Protests in York"
 commonwealth.2.d:0 "Due to the recent economic failure, many citizens have started to see the government as ineffective and have staged protests against the Lord-Protector system.\nThis appears to be an isolated event however, and the Lord-Protector himself has stated that he doesn't think these riots will escalate anymore past this.\nEither way, this spells bad news for the Commonwealth's future..."
 commonwealth.2.a:0 "Don't they know protests are illegal?"
 commonwealth.3.t:0 "Massive Strikes Across London"
 commonwealth.3.d:0 "The anti-government spirit clearly seems to live on in the people as protesters have managed to organise a strike which will have quite a toll on our economy, Pan-Germanicists are worried of this development and suggest that we try threaten these strikers to back down.\nThis could work but it would certainly risk international condemnation."
 commonwealth.3.a:0 "Let the fools strike all they want."
 commonwealth.3.b:0 "This calls for military action!"
 commonwealth.4.t:0 "Royalist Conspiracy?"
 commonwealth.4.d:0 "Disturbing news has came out about a Royalist conspiracy being afoot, paranoia is becoming rampant in the cabinet as strikers become rampant.\nIt has become hard to know who to trust, many are suspecting that even some of the highest government officials have Royalist sympathies, whatever the case is this is the Commonwealth's darkest year with traitorous Royalists clearly aiming for a coup of the government.\nIronside has been pressured by the Pan-Germanicist League to declare martial law, which has been officially announced to happen in a few weeks time."
 commonwealth.4.a:0 "These traitors must be stopped."
 commonwealth.5.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
 commonwealth.5.d:0 "In response to the growing threat of these 'Royalist terrorists' Ironside has officially declared martial law in Great Britain, most civil liberties have been suspended as a consequence.\nMany have cited this as proof that the government is corrupt and ineffective whilst some have taken this threat seriously and have decided to wisely shut up.\nIt isn't currently too clear if this could work but many in the government believe it will."
 commonwealth.5.a:0 "They're just Royalists!"
 commonwealth.6.t:0 "Civilian Pro-Protectorate Militias Form"
 commonwealth.6.d:0 "In response to all the pro-monarchist violence overtaking the country, loyal and brave civilians have taken it upon themselves to help the government with dealing with this problem once and for all.\nWhile the increase in violence isn't good for our public image, the fact that people are willing to battle on the streets for the regime is a well placed development. The government, for the most part, supports these groups but a small minority say supporting them will only lead us into more chaos as the Royalists would just assume that the government is attempting some form of purge against them.\nIronside, as well as a majority of the government, have denied such allegations and even imprisoned some of the people deemed 'dangerous to the state' because of their revolutionary ideas."
 commonwealth.6.a:0 "Law abiding citizens, true British heroes."
 commonwealth.7.t:0 "Battles in the Streets"
 commonwealth.7.d:0 "The Royalists know no limits as they do battle with the brave citizens who risen up in only loyalty to our government.\nThe Royalists have begun battles on the streets with these civilian militias, with a major battle occuring only a few hours ago in Newcastle which as estimates predict, has had over 130 deaths involved and nearly 2000 injuries.\nWe must urge the militias to fight on for the Protectorate."
 commonwealth.7.a:0 "These damn Royalists!"
 commonwealth.8.t:0 "Looking Up"
 commonwealth.8.d:0 "After a while of suffering, it seems that we are behind that now... the economy still suffers but the collapse has ended.\nThis is still very problematic though, the brief period of total economic collapse ruined many villages and even some city areas - with tons being unemployed.\nThe main problem is behind us, but it still rings its toll."
 commonwealth.8.a:0 "Some day we will be stronger."
 commonwealth.9.t:0 "Large Scale Royalist Unrest"
 commonwealth.9.d:0 "Reports have been sent of huge scale unrest in regions from Newcastle to Leicester, this is no longer just troubles in the populace - this is war.\nLarge scale fighting in the regions have guarenteed that any military personnel trying to cross through would be immeditely pelted and jeered at or, according to some reporters, even murdered by the civilians. While the zone is essentially demilitarised there is still large scale street battles in what some people have called a Second English Civil War.\nThe government is dubious at best with how to deal with the situation, but military involvement does seem to be the leading stance. Some are not enthusiastic though, and say that it could lead to a even larger increase of hostilities and lead to full scale civil war, these claims are deemed ridiculous."
 commonwealth.9.a:0 "These traitors will suffer!"
