 saxons.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of England"
 saxons.1.d:0 "Despite what looked like a hopeful future for the young Kingdom of England after the victory of Hastings which resulted in the death of William the Bastard and establishment of a personal union with the Duchy of Normandy, the rising Kingdom of France saw the threat England posed and managed to push her out of the continent; England was devastated by these conflicts which essentially bankrupted the country for decades. France had established herself as a feared and powerful nation in the continent - conquering huge swathes of the dormant Holy Roman Empire, meanwhile England was a tiny, insignificant local power which failed to exert influence on even the Marches of Wales. Overtime, the Kingdom of England's weakness became more and more evident from failure to failure against the Scots, Welsh and French. However, she was slowly growing in power after the beginning of the 15th century after the discovery of the American continents and by the 17th century had established herself a small but meaningful colonial empire in what would be later called the 'Golden Age of England,' this came to a quick end though when a major war with France taken nearly all the empire and sent the Kingdom of England into total economic collapse for nearly a hundred years. By the 1900s though France was in a state of turmoil herself, the resentful Bradford I and his ally, Spain declared war on France to seize the glory England had been missing for nearly a millenium; despite initial successes France managed to cause a humiliating defeat the pair. Bradford I's reputation and prestiege was ruined and his fate seemed to be set in stone as another failure of a King. Bradford I was stubborn though and didn't want to accept defeat even when he was in the jaws of it, a fragile economy, weak military and unpopular government was things England had surpassed in the past and will surpass in the future." 
 saxons.1.a:0 "Long live the King!"
 saxons.2.t:0 "England Requests We End Our Sanctions"
 saxons.2.d:0 "The Kingdom of England has requested to us that we end the long-standing sanctions that we have imposed on them, citing that it has damaged our economy just as much as it has damaged theirs. How do we respond?"
 saxons.2.a:0 "Very well, we will lift them."
 saxons.2.b:0 "If we do so we'll regret it in time."
 saxons.3.t:0 "France Lifts Sanctions"
 saxons.3.d:0 "Today is a great day for us, the French government has agreed to our proposal and has lifted all economic sanctions they have made on us, they still warn that we should follow the Treaty of Bordeaux however."
 saxons.3.a:0 "They made a good choice."
 saxons.4.t:0 "France Refuses"
 saxons.4.d:0 "The French government seems to have refused our proposal as when we sent our diplomat to the designated place for the meeting they didn't send anybody."
 saxons.4.a:0 "Disappointing."
 saxons.5.t:0 "Peasants Rally Up North"
 saxons.5.d:0 "The government's policy of autarky has resulted in a lot of the peasants, the lowest class, being significantly worse off due to how the policies severely make the lives of them worse through poverty. They have started a mass rally in the northern cities of Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield - many in the government are concered at the prospect that Bradford I could get overthrown from these revolts. Bradford I has been dismissive though, saying that they were just getting uppity and they would calm down later on; we will have to take his word for it..."
 saxons.5.a:0 "They're just communists!"
 saxons.6.t:0 "Peasants Raid Armouries!"
 saxons.6.d:0 "The rallying in the North has only gotten worse, with disturbing reports that the peasants have been stealing major weapon stockpiles and even capturing or killing some loyalists. A lot of the government is mass panic, some are attempting to leave the country or at least evacuate the areas where revolts are continually happening. Bradford I has been noticably shaken by all of this, a change in heart for the better, but it appears to have come too late as many rumors spread that the goal isn't just to stop the autarky policies, but to overthrow Bradford I enirely and establish a republic for themselves."
 saxons.6.a:0 "Disturbing."
 saxons.7.t:0 "Huge Scale Rebellion!"
 saxons.7.d:0 "The ultimate plan of the peasants has begun, they have used their captured guns to form their own army, and some of the members of our own military have changed side and started fighting for them. Bradford I has made a speech in London saying that all the rebel leaders are traitors and will be executed if captured, and that all of the soldiers that have switched sides will lose their jobs as soldiers but not be executed as soon as captured. The rebellion clearly has its own problems though, with many inside of their 'captured territory' still being loyal to Bradford I, causing a lot of infighting."
 saxons.7.a:0 "Charge!"
