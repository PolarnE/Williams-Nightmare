 ENG_english_militarism:0 "English Militarism"
 ENG_english_militarism_desc:0 "Ever since the early days of the old Empire the English have had a proud military culture that rivals even France or what the Prussians once had. Greatly encouraged by Cromwell and his New Model Army the English people have retained their heavily militarised culture despite the huge defeats we've suffered at the hands of our greatest enemy.\nLike all proud English people, we shall continue fighting and fighting until the day that our banner is raised over Paris and we can finally say that we've triumphed against our most steadfast foe."
 ENG_rampant_corruption_1:0 "Rampant Corruption"
 ENG_rampant_corruption_1_desc:0 "Corruption has always been a looming problem within our nation, noted but ignored. However, in the aftermath of the Great War the economy was completely ravaged and has never really recovered since. In complete desperation to save the doomed economy, the so far government friendly Pan-Germanicist League has been involved in large scale embezzlement and debasing so we can get shares of their large hold of the industry. The plan has saved our economy from complete destruction but it's resulted in our government becoming extremely corrupt and inefficient - public scandals have become the norm as a worryingly large amount of our economy is controlled by a single organisation that could switch alliegance at any moment."
 ENG_pan_germanicist_corruption_1:0 "Pan-Germanicist League - Loyal"
 ENG_pan_germanicist_corruption_1_desc:0 "§RThe Pan-Germanicist League is currently loyal to us.§!\n\nPerhaps the greatest mistake in the Commonwealth's history was using the Pan-Germanicist League's vast shares in the country's industry to try save the crippled and failing economy - that was decades ago but we're still in the shadow of that decision's consequences. Much of our government itself is members of the League and as a result their corruption has become a national institution of sorts."
 ENG_pan_germanicist_corruption_2:0 "Pan-Germanicist League - Content"
 ENG_pan_germanicist_corruption_2_desc:0 "§RThe Pan-Germanicist League is currently content with us.§!\n\nPerhaps the greatest mistake in the Commonwealth's history was using the Pan-Germanicist League's vast shares in the country's industry to try save the crippled and failing economy - that was decades ago but we're still in the shadow of that decision's consequences.

 ENG_economy_1:0 "Weak Economy"
 ENG_economy_1_desc:0 "Since the end of the Great War the economy has greatly suffered with no end of the recession in sight, the common man lives in poverty with a huge amount of the country's wealth being siphoned to the ruling class - most prominantly the Pan-Germanicists. If we never do anything about the economic crisis then we're destined to live as a liability instead of a Great Power."

 ENG_economy_5:0 "Severe Hyperinflation"
 ENG_economy_5_desc:0 "The Pound, once a common global currency, has become completely worthless - all the value it once had is completely gone and as a result unemployment, misery and poverty have had a huge and concerning rise. A big concern in this is the League too, they're very responsible for this but they're likely to react with nothing but fury."

 ENG_in_the_shadow_of_france_desc:0 "The Anglo-French rivalry, perhaps one of the oldest and most famous rivalries in history, has ended in a total defeat for the Commonwealth.\nWhen it became clear after Napoleon's conquest of Europe that France had to be put down it's only ended in solidifying the French position in the continent. As a result, we've been living in the shadow of the French for over a century - our relations towards France are nothing but concentrated hatred and we dream vividly of one day raising the flag over the burning ruins of Paris."
