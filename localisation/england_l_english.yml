 commonwealth.1.t:0 "Economic Depression Hits the Protectorate"
 commonwealth.1.d:0 "We've been trading heavily with France for quite a while due to their empire containing lots of valuable resources, this has came to hit us hard as the recent depression in France has severely damaged our economy.\nStocks are plummeting rapidly with it still decreasing right now, many in the cabinet are worried about the future of the country as it seems more and more likely that a popular revolt could be staged that might risk even overthrowing the Lord-Protector system."
 commonwealth.1.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 commonwealth.2.t:0 "Anti-Government Protests in York"
 commonwealth.2.d:0 "Due to the recent economic failure, many citizens have started to see the government as ineffective and have staged protests against the Lord-Protector system.\nThis appears to be an isolated event however, and the Lord-Protector himself has stated that he doesn't think these riots will escalate anymore past this.\nEither way, this spells bad news for the Commonwealth's future..."
 commonwealth.2.a:0 "Don't they know protests are illegal?"
 commonwealth.3.t:0 "Massive Strikes Across London"
 commonwealth.3.d:0 "The anti-government spirit clearly seems to live on in the people as protesters have managed to organise a strike which will have quite a toll on our economy, Pan-Germanicists are worried of this development and suggest that we try threaten these strikers to back down.\nThis could work but it would certainly risk international condemnation."
 commonwealth.3.a:0 "Let the fools strike all they want."
 commonwealth.3.b:0 "This calls for military action!"
 commonwealth.4.t:0 "Royalist Conspiracy?"
 commonwealth.4.d:0 "Disturbing news has came out about a Royalist conspiracy being afoot, paranoia is becoming rampant in the cabinet as strikers become rampant.\nIt has become hard to know who to trust, many are suspecting that even some of the highest government officials have Royalist sympathies, whatever the case is this is the Commonwealth's darkest year with traitorous Royalists clearly aiming for a coup of the government.\nIronside has been pressured by the Pan-Germanicist League to declare martial law, which has been officially announced to happen in a few weeks time."
 commonwealth.4.a:0 "These traitors must be stopped."
 commonwealth.5.t:0 "Martial Law Declared"
 commonwealth.5.d:0 "In response to the growing threat of these 'Royalist terrorists' Ironside has officially declared martial law in Great Britain, most civil liberties have been suspended as a consequence.\nMany have cited this as proof that the government is corrupt and ineffective whilst some have taken this threat seriously and have decided to wisely shut up.\nIt isn't currently too clear if this could work but many in the government believe it will."
 commonwealth.5.a:0 "They're just Royalists!"
 commonwealth.6.t:0 "Civilian Pro-Protectorate Militias Form"
 commonwealth.6.d:0 "In response to all the pro-monarchist violence overtaking the country, loyal and brave civilians have taken it upon themselves to help the government with dealing with this problem once and for all.\nWhile the increase in violence isn't good for our public image, the fact that people are willing to battle on the streets for the regime is a well placed development. The government, for the most part, supports these groups but a small minority say supporting them will only lead us into more chaos as the Royalists would just assume that the government is attempting some form of purge against them.\nIronside, as well as a majority of the government, have denied such allegations and even imprisoned some of the people deemed 'dangerous to the state' because of their revolutionary ideas."
 commonwealth.6.a:0 "Law abiding citizens, true British heroes."
 commonwealth.7.t:0 "Battles in the Streets"
 commonwealth.7.d:0 "The Royalists know no limits as they do battle with the brave citizens who risen up in only loyalty to our government.\nThe Royalists have begun battles on the streets with these civilian militias, with a major battle occuring only a few hours ago in Newcastle which as estimates predict, has had over 130 deaths involved and nearly 2000 injuries.\nWe must urge the militias to fight on for the Protectorate."
 commonwealth.7.a:0 "These damn Royalists!"
 commonwealth.8.t:0 "Looking Up"
 commonwealth.8.d:0 "After a while of suffering, it seems that we are behind that now... the economy still suffers but the collapse has ended.\nThis is still very problematic though, the brief period of total economic collapse ruined many villages and even some city areas - with tons being unemployed.\nThe main problem is behind us, but it still rings its toll."
 commonwealth.8.a:0 "Some day we will be stronger."
 commonwealth.9.t:0 "Large Scale Royalist Unrest"
 commonwealth.9.d:0 "Reports have been sent of huge scale unrest in regions from Newcastle to Leicester, this is no longer just troubles in the populace - this is war.\nLarge scale fighting in the regions have guarenteed that any military personnel trying to cross through would be immeditely pelted and jeered at or, according to some reporters, even murdered by the civilians. While the zone is essentially demilitarised there is still large scale street battles in what some people have called a Second English Civil War.\nThe government is dubious at best with how to deal with the situation, but military involvement does seem to be the leading stance. Some are not enthusiastic though, and say that it could lead to a even larger increase of hostilities and lead to full scale civil war, these claims are deemed ridiculous."
 commonwealth.9.a:0 "These traitors will suffer!"
 commonwealth.10.t:0 "Scottish Nationalism Explodes in Popularity"
 commonwealth.10.d:0 "For the most part, Scottish nationalist sentiment has been kept relatively low due to the large cultural acceptance and support that Scotland gets.\nHowever, with the recent problems the government is facing the Scots are increasingly growing more restless with the threat of most of Scotland outright seceding from our union when the right opportunity strikes for them.\nThis is really concerning for maintaining our state."
 commonwealth.10.a:0 "They're the racists!"
 commonwealth.11.t:0 "York Armoury Raid"
 commonwealth.11.d:0 "Due to the military having difficulties moving around our own country, armouries have been relatively unguarded with only garrisons being able to protect it, but now one of the largest armouries in York has had a garrison forced to surrender with the weapons being reportedly stolen and taken to an unknown destination.\nBecause of this, civil war seems more and more likely as time progresses which is a scary prospect for the people and government.\nCan the Protectorate survive?"
 commonwealth.11.a:0 "This isn't good."
 commonwealth.12.t:0 "Mass General Desertion"
 commonwealth.12.d:0 "Horrifying news for the Protectorate has arrived, a large portion of our military leaders have deserted their posts in what the government is certain on being a Royalist Plot, this brings down the mood for everyone except the monarchist sympathisers as it seems a civil war is only imminent."
 commonwealth.12.a:0 "How dishonourable."
 ENG_generals_desert_tooltip:0 "We will lose a lot of §YRoyalist sympathising military leaders§!."
 commonwealth.13.t:0 "Scottish Nationalism Seizes Scotland"
 commonwealth.13.d:0 "Over the past few months Scottish nationalism has been on a monumental rise despite efforts to supress it, the Scots have pretty much achieved what they've been demanding for so long - more autonomy.\nMuch like Northern England our army has been entirely prevented from moving in between our own territory without risk of bombardment and massacre. It's quickly becoming more and more clear that the government will have problems keeping the country united."
 commonwealth.13.a:0 "We will do so in force if we must."
 swedish_temp_alliance:0 "Svensk-Pakten"
 english_temp_alliance:0 "Republicans"
 commonwealth.14.t:0 "Duumvirate Suspension"
 commonwealth.14.d:0 "Due to the clear signs of our nation collapsing into civil war, the Swedish government has decided to suspend their membership in the Duumvirate 'until further notice.' Some see this action as justified as the Protectorate is clearly in a very unstable position, whilst others see it as outright betrayal and proof that Sweden was attempting to exploit us for their own gain.\nWhatever their motive, this only worsens our position."
 commonwealth.14.a:0 "Whatever."
 commonwealth.15.t:0 "Royalists Attempt Coup!"
 commonwealth.15.d:0 "It has all culminated to this moment, the Royalists believe that they're strong enough to seize control of Britain and have attempted a coup to proclaim Willelme II King of England, the coup has failed but this is clearly the boiling point as their army is seizing territory in the north.\nWorse too, Scotland has seceded from our country and has engaged with fighting us as well. But due to our general acceptance of the Scottish people there is a pro-government army that has seized land near Inverness to try fight for our cause.\nWho do we support?\nLord-Protector or King?"
 commonwealth.15.a:0 "We've survived 300 years and we'll survive 300 more!"
 commonwealth.15.b:0 "All hail the King! (Play as Royalists)"
 commonwealth.16.t:0 "Victory in the Civil War!"
 commonwealth.16.d:0 "The last Royalist strongholds have been captured and it has become clear that we have won this conflict and survived through unrest. Only a few hours ago Ironside has announced a Republican victory, saying that the people who rose up to defend the Protectorate are some of the greatest heroes in the country, even challenging legends like Oliver Cromwell.\nAll traitors to the government have been either executed, killed in battle or have managed to escape to foreign nations.\nOur journey doesn't end here though as we still need to contend with the remaining threats to our state with the economic hardship still affecting us and a remaining low amount of support for the government.\nNow the Lord is Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
 commonwealth.16.a:0 "The greatest victory is yet to come."
 commonwealth.17.t:0 "Welsh Rebellion"
 commonwealth.17.d:0 "The scheming Welsh people have finally rebelled against our government in the time of troubles, clearly aiming for Welsh determination in response to 'English oppression.'"
 commonwealth.17.a:0 "They will regret their idiocy."
 commonwealth.18.t:0 "The Scottish Question"
 commonwealth.18.d:0 "Scotland has been an administrative pain for the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth ever since its creation and it is clear that now, more than ever, we need to solve these problems. Several ideas have been drawn up like giving them minor concessions but widely keeping the status quo, making Scotland an equal partner in the Commonwealth and outright revoking the Act of Solidarity but retaining the personal union between heads of state."
 commonwealth.18.a:0 "Minor concessions will shut them up."
 commonwealth.18.b:0 "Making an equal union is necessary for our survival."
 commonwealth.18.c:0 "Revoke the Act of Solidarity."
 commonwealthsupport.7.t:0 "The Commonwealth Requests Economic Co-operation"
 commonwealthsupport.7.d:0 "In an attempt to save their economy the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth has turned to us in a request for mutual economic co-operation, whilst it's rather clear that the English will benifit far more from this than us it would still be a profitable venture."
 commonwealthsupport.7.a:0 "We will support our allies."
 commonwealthsupport.7.b:0 "They're not necessary to our interests."
 commonwealthsupport.8.t:0 "Sweden Accepts"
 commonwealthsupport.8.d:0 "Sweden has responded to our request for increased economic co-operation positively and has agreed to the plan. Together we will be stronger than before."
 commonwealthsupport.8.a:0 "Great news!"

 commonwealthsupport.9.a:0 "Traitors."
 commonwealthsupport.10.t:0 "The Commonwealth Seeks Investment Into Us"
 commonwealthsupport.10.d:0 "With the recent wave of reforms in the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth which driven the economy away from being state controlled they have requested that we let in investors into our country, whilst this could be extremely profitable for both of us - can we really trust them?"
 commonwealthsupport.10.a:0 "France is a bigger threat!"
 commonwealthsupport.10.b:0 "Net!"
 commonwealthsupport.11.t:0 "Russia Accepts"
 commonwealthsupport.11.d:0 "Russia has accepted our offer, seeing France as a far larger threat than the Duumvirate at the moment they have let the investors in."
 commonwealthsupport.11.a:0 "Great news!"
 commonwealthsupport.12.t:0 "Russia Refuses"
 commonwealthsupport.12.d:0 "Distrust from the old Great War clearly looms on in the Russian government as they have refused our generous offers to make them rich."

 commonwealthsupport.1.d:0 "With the Second English Civil War breaking out in Great Britain, the Protectorate has reached out to us and asked for our support in the cause against the Royalists.\nAgreeing to send advisors would help them greatly but is it really worth the cost?"

 commonwealthsupport.3.t:0 "Sweden Betrays Us"

 commonwealthsupport.4.a:0 "We will assist those in need."
 commonwealthsupport.4.b:0 "Mighty Russia sees no need to help in petty squabbles."
 commonwealthsupport.5.t:0 "Russia Agrees"
 commonwealthsupport.5.d:0 "Russia has responded positively to our appeal asking for support, agreeing with our reasoning that we're comrades in the fight against imperialism from the French.\nThis will assist us greatly and could possibly lead to much more with Russia."
 commonwealthsupport.5.a:0 "True heroes of the Commonwealth!"
 commonwealthsupport.6.t:0 "Russia Refuses"
