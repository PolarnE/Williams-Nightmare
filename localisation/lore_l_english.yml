RUS_lore:0 "The white faction; democratic forces led by Lev Davidovich have managed to seize power over the old Russian Empire. By the end of the war, the Tsar and fellow monarchists managed to escape our clutches by going into Alaska. The new Russia requires closed borders to preserve herself for it is time to rebuild. Today, after 2 long years the Russian Federation has consolidated its territories and Lev has been elected for president, with the establishment of Duma parliament and other democratic institutions.\nTime will tell whether the new paradise and its people survive the test of time."
ENG_lore:0 "Following the disastrous defeat of the Duumvirate by the French in the Great War, the Protectorate is barely holding onto power. Monarchists opting for the restoration of the monarchy have allied with Pan-Germanic Nationalists who see England as being a rightful state of a United Deustchland in one common goal; defeat of the Lord-Protector. \n The Duumvirate Alliance proves to be shaky at best, with Swedish politics differing more and more from English. \nWill the new Lord-Protector Edmund Ironside be able to keep the Cromwellian Republic together, or will the nation crumble? Only time can tell."
GER_lore:0 "The Kingdom of Prussia was punished harshly by the French for being the catalyst that begun the Great War, being split in two with the old state of Brandenburg being revived, taking the capital of Berlin with it.\nPresident Rommel, a War Hero from the Great War, radicalised politically in England and religiously in Sweden seeks to undo these unjust punishments and complete the goal Germans have been trying for centuries- Uniting the Deustch People. \nReforming the Prussian Republic into a totalitarian dictatorship, Erwin Rommel now seeks to expand his power and eagerly waits for a show of weakness from the French."

Decades ago the Great War started which threatened French dominance of the continent, however victory came with Russian collapse.\nNapoleon the Great's empire is far weaker than it was in the glory days but his legacy still lives on in the heart of many..."
CHI_lore:0 "Emperor Yuan Shikai's coup of the young Republic of China was deemed suicidal by many, especially during the battlefields of the Great War. But his empire managed to live on past the initial struggle for the people's recognition with support from the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth, however the warmongering Russians have reignited the long dead flame of the Great Qing to our dismay.\nEmperor Jiefang struck a deal with the Kuomintang to save the empire by adopting a more constitutional monarchy, radical factions like the followers of Mao Zedong would like to see Jiefang deposed entirely though."
SWE_lore:0 "Sweden has developed a fearsome reputation amongst her peers with the recent victories that granted her Finland, Karelia and the Murmansk, it's said that the most deadly weapon on Earth is a Swedish jager with a rifle.\nThis reputation has put Sweden on her highest point in centuries, and with the Duumvirate alliance with the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth, Sweden seems unstoppable!\nThe Swedish juggernaut starts with no immediate threats, but the unpopular rule over Finland is quickly reaching a boiling point and could be a threat for the Kingdom."
USA_lore:0 "The Federal Republic of Louisiana is the black sheep of the American continent, a relatively weak and fragile nation with only 1 major colonial outpost, many historians theorise the potential the once emerging nation had.\nUpon independence the people of the new republic quickly uncovered the core of rot behind the paint of revolutionary glory, Louisiana was a bloated and unstable powderkeg, barely able to stand up to the Russians and Mexicans; its land in the Americas has barely changed since the country's birth.\nLouisiana starts as an isolationist state with huge ethnic tension problems that have yet to be solved."
RAJ_lore:0 "The Marathan Socialist People's Republic is a relatively young emerging nation, often not taken seriously by the other great powers of the world, after the glorious revolutionaries of the 1905 Revolution deposed the tyrannical Marathan nobility and established the first maletist state the main goal of the country is to cause a world-wide maletist revolution by fueling independence movements in the many colonies of Europe.\nAt the beginning they start in a precarious situation, the Indian subcontinent has been devoured by the Russians, French and other imperialists."
