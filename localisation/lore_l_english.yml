RUS_lore:0 "The white faction; democratic forces led by Lev Davidovich have managed to seize power over the old Russian Empire. By the end of the war, the Tsar and fellow monarchists managed to escape our clutches by going into Alaska. The new Russia requires closed borders to preserve herself for it is time to rebuild. Today, after 2 long years the Russian Federation has consolidated its territories and Lev has been elected for president, with the establishment of Duma parliament and other democratic institutions.\nTime will tell whether the new paradise and its people survive the test of time."
ENG_lore:0 "Following the disastrous defeat of the Duumvirate by the French in the Great War, the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth is barely holding onto power. Monarchists opting for the restoration of the Monarchy have allied with Pan-Germanic Nationalists who see England as being a rightful state of a United Deustchland in one common goal; defeat of the Lord-Protector. \n The Duumvirate Alliance also proves to be shaky at best, with Swedish politics differing more and more from English. \n Will the new Lord-Protector Edmund Ironside be able to keep the Cromwellian Republic together, or will the nation crumble? Only time can tell."
GER_lore:0 "The Kingdom of Prussia was punished harshly by the French for being the catylist that begun the Great War. Split in two and seperated from Brandenburg, the divide was felt not just in the borders of the nation but in its very heart and soul. \n President Rommel, a War Hero from the Great War, radicalised politically in England and religiously in Sweden seeks to undo these unjust punishments and complete the goal Germans have been trying for centuries- Uniting the Deustch People. \n Reforming the Prussian Republic into the Ostdeustch Staat, Erwin Rommel now seeks to expand his power and eagerly waits for a show of weakness from the French."
