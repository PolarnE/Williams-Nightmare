  maratha.1.t:0 "France is Distracted"
  maratha.1.d:0 "With the Great Depression kicking off in Europe we've got a golden opportunity to expand the Maletist revolution to our brothers and sisters in Mysore, due to their isolated position and relative lack of power against France our generals are confident there will not be a response from them. It could even cause the collapse of their disgusting Empire as a whole by encouraging their many subjects to rise up in defiance."
  maratha.1.a:0 "For a united Hindustan!"
  mysore.1.t:0 "An Interesting Offer"
  mysore.1.d:0 "A diplomat from the Marathan Socialist People's Republic has came to us with an interesting offer, we 'free ourselves from the shackles of France' and join them in their Maletist revolution. Whilst we do have very limited power under 'protection' by France surrendering our indepence and most likely getting the royal family murdered by these revolutionaries isn't appealing to some of our government."
  mysore.1.a:0 "For a united Hindustan!"
  mysore.1.b:0 "Request France for support against the vile Maletists."
  mysore.2.t:0 "France Backs Us"
  mysore.2.d:0 "The French government, like we predicted, quickly responded to our request and have publicly stated that their protectorate over us will remain despite their current economic crisis to the dismay of the Marathans."
  mysore.2.a:0 "We knew we could trust them."
  mysore.3.t:0 "France Abandons Us"
  mysore.3.d:0 "The French government seems to have entirely ignored our request, not even sending any response at all. This essentially guarantees the destruction of our state but we will still fight on despite the poor odds."
  mysore.3.a:0 "Traitors."
  maratha.2.t:0 "Failure in Mysore"
  maratha.2.d:0 "The French have backed their tiny puppet state of Mysore and then sent us a warning demanding we don't touch them. For now we will have to accept this humiliating defeat as we'd have no hopes in winning a war against them even in their current state, but the next time we're back the French Empire will have fallen and the foolish monarchy all dead."
  maratha.2.a:0 "Retreat and regroup."
  maratha.3.t:0 "Mysore Crisis Ends in Victory"
  maratha.3.d:0 "Whilst the tiny state of Mysore did provide resistance to their ineviatable annexation the French haven't given any indication of their backing of their supposed protectorate. Now's our chance to quickly invade them and incorporate them into our glorious revolution!"
  maratha.3.a:0 "We're the victors in the end."

  RAJ_dissolved_military:0 "Worker's Militias"
  RAJ_dissolved_military_desc:0 "As a response to the November coup attempt, Parliament dissolved the military and ordered a mass purge of suspected disloyal generals on the 12th December, 1935 - stating that it had become decadent and corrupt and must be reformed into a true force of liberation for the workers. For the forseeable future though, the Marathan military is entirely composed of so called Worker's Militias."

  RAJ_ships:0 "Naval Blueprints"
  RAJ_lessdissolved_military:0 "Reorganized Worker's Militias"
  RAJ_lessdissolved_military_desc:0 "After a long campaign of negotations with the leaders of the various militias, we've managed to reorganise them into a more disciplined and professional military force. From now on, they will answer to our high command instead of whatever warlord they previously served."

  RAJ_nogood:0 "Weak Goverment"
  RAJ_nogood_desc:0 "Although the November coup attempt by the military was quickly crushed it has put a scar on our leadership - the Marathan Worker's Congress is divided and unorganised, until we can elect proper leadership our country will suffer from instability via the weak government."
  RAJ_wechoz:0 "President has been elected!"
  RAJ_wechoz_desc:0 "The Marathan Worker's Congress has finally elected a new President which has at large brought political stability to the country, although government opposition does still exist it's currently too minor to pose any real threat to us."
  RAJ_needfood:0 "Extreme Famine"
  RAJ_needfood_desc:0 "Drought hit us at the worst possible time, because of the President being dead and the Congress busy fighting between itself a large famine has broken out in the country that has completely devastated our countyside and caused huge problems with our economy. As soon as solid leadership is found it must be a priority to end the famine."

  RAJ_uni:0 "Expand Universities"

  RAJ_dockyards_focus:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
  RAJ_dockyards_focus_desc:0 "A strong navy is an important part in any country's life, protecting trade and enforcing control on overseas territory would be far harder without a large enough navy to back it.

  RAJ_blabla:0 "Rally the Working Class"

  RAJ_nacionalization:0 "Seize European Assets"
  RAJ_nacionalization_desc:0 "The fact a disturbing amount of our economy is still indirectly or directly controlled by the European imperialists is a truth that we've been indecisive or even ignored entirely. Today, we will seize all of these assets and redistribute them amongst the people who've suffered from their harsh oppression."
  RAJ_slots:0 "Countryside Urbanization"
  RAJ_slots_desc:0 "One of Charles Malet's beliefs is that only industrial nations would even be capable of embracing his ideology, our economy is still mostly rural based despite our rapid economic growth and we've yet to achieve our dream of establishing the true utopian state he dreamed of. By supporting urbanization of countrysides we can rapidly increase our industrial base."
  RAJ_highways_tt:0 "Add maximum §YInfrastructure§! in §YDelhi, Lucknow, Jabalpur§! and §YHyderabad.§!"
  RAJ_highway:0 "Trans-Hindustan Railway"
  RAJ_highway_desc:0 "The construction of a great railway between Delhi and Shaharkeeaasha will, if our envisionments of it turn out to come true, will unite the country together and rapidly increase infrastructure for the areas surrounding this great line. Later on we will surely develop more, but this will be the first."
  RAJ_civs:0 "Expand the Civilian Economy"

  RAJ_rubber:0 "Expand the Rubber Sector"
  RAJ_rubber_desc:0 "Rubber, whilst not as desired as oil, is still a valuable resource for any nation that wants to produce even basic products, in the modern world rubber is becoming less and less of a commodity but it has more and more uses. We can use this to our advantage and develop our economy with rubber money."
  RAJ_otherplan:0 "Economic Investment Plan"
  RAJ_otherplan_desc:0 "The great plans envisioned by some of our economists doesn't seem viable without huge sacrifices in other departments, it'd be better for us if we just retained the status quo and focused on establishing an industrial economy without radical measures."
  RAJ_learn:0 "Reform the Education System"
  RAJ_learn_desc:0 "Simply just expanding universities won't be enough for solving the drastic problems our country faces on the education front, a drastic overhaul of the entire system is necessary if we want to truly establish a utopian society."
  RAJ_RADAR:0 "Radar Development"
  RAJ_RADAR_desc:0 "Other nations view us with suspicious and envy, we must greatly expand our knowledge and strength of Radars to be able to prepare a better defense in the eventual war for our future."
  RAJ_indianexcevation:0 "Resource Exploitation"
  RAJ_indianexcevation_desc:0 "Our country has got almost everything it needs to be self-sustaining, by looking into resource explotation and excavation we can better exploit that natural resources at our disposal for the future of the state."
  RAJ_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure Subsides"
  RAJ_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our country's infrastucture is severely lacking and lagging behind even the most backward nations of the world like Russia. A large scale operation of subsidising heavily into our nation's infrastucture should make the process of its construction smoother and faster."
  RAJ_buildings:0 "Industrial Subsidies"
  RAJ_buildings_desc:0 "We don't have the same luxury as many other countries of having heaps and heaps of factories up for their disposal and abuse. We need to start from scratch, by subsiding into key industries we can improve our speed of contructing factories."

  RAJ_dockyardsN_desc:0 "To stop potential raids against our precious goods being exported we must greatly expand the capability of our dockyards so we can dominate the regions that we're naturally supposed to."
  RAJ_subsideN:0 "Naval Expansion"
  RAJ_subsideN_desc:0 "Our naval capabilities are even worse than our general industrial ones, for now our attention must be turned to the navy so we can make the industry more productive and capable of building a fleet that can defend us."
  RAJ_subsideL:0 "Factory Expansion"
  RAJ_subsideL_desc:0 "The greater priority in the ordeal of industrialisation are increasing how much factories we have so we'd have a chance at keeping up with the foreign colonial powers who tear up our lands."
  RAJ_industryL:0 "Construct New Factories"
  RAJ_industryL_desc:0 "On top of our expansion of the already existing factories, we should construct far more of them. A project of this magnitude has yet to be done before by any of the great enemies we have collected, they will surely envy us even more after this great project."
  RAJ_idontevenknow:0 "Economic Miracle"
  RAJ_idontevenknow_desc:0 "With our wise subsidies and investments we have managed to cause an economic miracle within our country. The once shambling and weak Marathan economy is now far stronger and booming."
