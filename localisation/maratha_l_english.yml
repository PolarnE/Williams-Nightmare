  maratha.1.t:0 "France is Distracted"
  maratha.1.d:0 "With the Great Depression kicking off in Europe we've got a golden opportunity to expand the Maletist revolution to our brothers and sisters in Mysore, due to their isolated position and relative lack of power against France our generals are confident there will not be a response from them. It could even cause the collapse of their disgusting Empire as a whole by encouraging their many subjects to rise up in defiance."
  maratha.1.a:0 "For a united Hindustan!"
  mysore.1.t:0 "An Interesting Offer"
  mysore.1.d:0 "A diplomat from the Marathan Socialist People's Republic has came to us with an interesting offer, we 'free ourselves from the shackles of France' and join them in their Maletist revolution. Whilst we do have very limited power under 'protection' by France surrendering our indepence and most likely getting the royal family murdered by these revolutionaries isn't appealing to some of our government."
  mysore.1.a:0 "For a united Hindustan!"
  mysore.1.b:0 "Request France for support against the vile Maletists."
  mysore.2.t:0 "France Backs Us"
  mysore.2.d:0 "The French government, like we predicted, quickly responded to our request and have publicly stated that their protectorate over us will remain despite their current economic crisis to the dismay of the Marathans."
  mysore.2.a:0 "We knew we could trust them."
  mysore.3.t:0 "France Abandons Us"
  mysore.3.d:0 "The French government seems to have entirely ignored our request, not even sending any response at all. This essentially guarantees the destruction of our state but we will still fight on despite the poor odds."
  mysore.3.a:0 "Traitors."
  maratha.2.t:0 "Failure in Mysore"
  maratha.2.d:0 "The French have backed their tiny puppet state of Mysore and then sent us a warning demanding we don't touch them. For now we will have to accept this humiliating defeat as we'd have no hopes in winning a war against them even in their current state, but the next time we're back the French Empire will have fallen and the foolish monarchy all dead."
  maratha.2.a:0 "Retreat and regroup."
  maratha.3.t:0 "Mysore Crisis Ends in Victory"
  maratha.3.d:0 "Whilst the tiny state of Mysore did provide resistance to their ineviatable annexation the French haven't given any indication of their backing of their supposed protectorate. Now's our chance to quickly invade them and incorporate them into our glorious revolution!"
  maratha.3.a:0 "We're the victors in the end."
  #ideas
  RAJ_dissolved_military:0 "Worker's Militias"
  RAJ_dissolved_military_desc:0 "As a response to the November coup attempt, Parliament dissolved the military and ordered a mass purge of suspected disloyal generals on the 12th December, 1935 - stating that it had become decadent and corrupt and must be reformed into a true force of liberation for the workers. For the forseeable future though, the Marathan military is entirely composed of so called Worker's Militias."
  RAJ_dockyards:0 "Naval Commission"
  RAJ_ships:0 "Naval Blueprints"
  RAJ_lessdissolved_military:0 "Reorganized Worker's Militias"
  RAJ_lessdissolved_military_desc:0 "After a long campaign of negotations with the leaders of the various militias, we've managed to reorganise them into a more disciplined and professional military force. From now on, they will answer to our high command instead of whatever warlord they previously served."

  RAJ_pentagon_desc:0 "As the world is slowly becoming more and more dangerous we're forced to adapt ourselves to defend against possible future aggressors. With a unified Ministry on defence we will have increased organization and planning within our forces and be more able to defend against whoever would dare attack us."
  RAJ_nogood:0 "Weak Goverment"
  RAJ_nogood_desc:0 "Although the November coup attempt by the military was quickly crushed it has put a scar on our leadership - the Marathan Worker's Congress is divided and unorganised, until we can elect proper leadership our country will suffer from instability via the weak government."
  RAJ_wechoz:0 "President has been elected!"
  RAJ_wechoz_desc:0 "The Marathan Worker's Congress has finally elected a new President which has at large brought political stability to the country, although government opposition does still exist it's currently too minor to pose any real threat to us."
  RAJ_needfood:0 "Extreme Famine"
  RAJ_needfood_desc:0 "Drought hit us at the worst possible time, because of the President being dead and the Congress busy fighting between itself a large famine has broken out in the country that has completely devastated our countyside and caused huge problems with our economy. As soon as solid leadership is found it must be a priority to end the famine."
  RAJ_easierfam:0 "Famine"
  RAJ_easierfam_desc:0 "Thanks to our new policies we were able to reduce effect of famine."
  RAJ_education:0 "Free Education"
  RAJ_educate:0 "Free Education"
  RAJ_educate_desc:0 "Gandhi has said several times before that a self-proclaimed socialist utopia not even having basic human rights like education be free is barbaric and should be stopped immediately so that everyone is able to have a quality education and not be forced into manual labor."
  RAJ_civs3:0 "Expand Housing"
  RAJ_civs3_desc:0 "Too much of the population is living homeless or forced into tight conditions due to houses either being too unaffordable or there simply not being enough of them, with a large scale construction project we can both increase the popularity of Gandhi and work towards ending this crisis."

  #focuses
  RAJ_plan:0 "5 Year Plan"
  RAJ_plan_desc:0 "Hindustan is vastly rural and in dire need of a more developed economy to achieve the imagined utopia set forth by Malet. A long term campaign of industrialization will be what bonds our country together."
  RAJ_uni:0 "Expand Universities"
  RAJ_uni_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that a large amount of our population is uneducated and not even literate, by greatly expanding the small universities we have we will be able to launch a huge education campaign that will educate our workers and shine new light in our future."
  RAJ_dockyards_focus:0 "Dockyard Expansion"
  RAJ_dockyards_focus_desc:0 "A strong navy is an important part in any country's life, protecting trade and enforcing control on overseas territory would be far harder without a large enough navy to back it. With the expansion of our already existing ports we will be able to harbour a much larger navy."
  RAJ_blabla:0 "Rally the Working Class"
  RAJ_blabla_desc:0 "Our great socialist utopia wouldn't be possible without the great contributions of the workers, by making several speeches we can make sure that their loyalty is continued we can continue our rally of them."
  RAJ_nacionalization:0 "Seize European Assets"
  RAJ_nacionalization_desc:0 "The fact a disturbing amount of our economy is still indirectly or directly controlled by the European imperialists is a truth that we've been indecisive or even ignored entirely. Today, we will seize all of these assets and redistribute them amongst the people who've suffered from their harsh oppression."
  RAJ_slots:0 "Countryside Urbanization"
  RAJ_slots_desc:0 "One of Charles Malet's beliefs is that only industrial nations would even be capable of embracing his ideology, our economy is still mostly rural based despite our rapid economic growth and we've yet to achieve our dream of establishing the true utopian state he dreamed of. By supporting urbanization of countrysides we can rapidly increase our industrial base."
  RAJ_highways_tt:0 "Add maximum §YInfrastructure§! in §YDelhi, Lucknow, Jabalpur§! and §YHyderabad.§!"
  RAJ_highway:0 "Trans-Hindustan Railway"
  RAJ_highway_desc:0 "The construction of a great railway between Delhi and Shaharkeeaasha will, if our envisionments of it turn out to come true, will unite the country together and rapidly increase infrastructure for the areas surrounding this great line. Later on we will surely develop more, but this will be the first."
  RAJ_civs:0 "Expand the Civilian Economy"
  RAJ_civs_desc:0 "The people who must prosper the most under our regime are the common man, using our new Trans-Hindustan Railway we will be able to build up many areas of our relatively underdeveloped civilian industry."
  RAJ_oil:0 "Expand the Oil Sector"
  RAJ_oil_desc:0 "Fossil fuels are highly sought after by many other nations, by increasing our output by tenfold we will be able to strengthen our economy via oil money rolling in at a steady pace alongside other sources of income."
  RAJ_rubber:0 "Expand the Rubber Sector"
  RAJ_rubber_desc:0 "Rubber, whilst not as desired as oil, is still a valuable resource for any nation that wants to produce even basic products, in the modern world rubber is becoming less and less of a commodity but it has more and more uses. We can use this to our advantage and develop our economy with rubber money."
  RAJ_otherplan:0 "Economic Investment Plan"
  RAJ_otherplan_desc:0 "The great plans envisioned by some of our economists doesn't seem viable without huge sacrifices in other departments, it'd be better for us if we just retained the status quo and focused on establishing an industrial economy without radical measures."
  RAJ_learn:0 "Reform the Education System"
  RAJ_learn_desc:0 "Simply just expanding universities won't be enough for solving the drastic problems our country faces on the education front, a drastic overhaul of the entire system is necessary if we want to truly establish a utopian society."
  RAJ_RADAR:0 "Radar Development"
  RAJ_RADAR_desc:0 "Other nations view us with suspicious and envy, we must greatly expand our knowledge and strength of Radars to be able to prepare a better defense in the eventual war for our future."
  RAJ_indianexcevation:0 "Resource Exploitation"
  RAJ_indianexcevation_desc:0 "Our country has got almost everything it needs to be self-sustaining, by looking into resource explotation and excavation we can better exploit that natural resources at our disposal for the future of the state."
  RAJ_infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure Subsides"
  RAJ_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our country's infrastucture is severely lacking and lagging behind even the most backward nations of the world like Russia. A large scale operation of subsidising heavily into our nation's infrastucture should make the process of its construction smoother and faster."
  RAJ_buildings:0 "Industrial Subsidies"
  RAJ_buildings_desc:0 "We don't have the same luxury as many other countries of having heaps and heaps of factories up for their disposal and abuse. We need to start from scratch, by subsiding into key industries we can improve our speed of contructing factories."
  RAJ_dockyardsN:0 "Protect Trade"
  RAJ_dockyardsN_desc:0 "To stop potential raids against our precious goods being exported we must greatly expand the capability of our dockyards so we can dominate the regions that we're naturally supposed to."
  RAJ_subsideN:0 "Naval Expansion"
  RAJ_subsideN_desc:0 "Our naval capabilities are even worse than our general industrial ones, for now our attention must be turned to the navy so we can make the industry more productive and capable of building a fleet that can defend us."
  RAJ_subsideL:0 "Factory Expansion"
  RAJ_subsideL_desc:0 "The greater priority in the ordeal of industrialisation are increasing how much factories we have so we'd have a chance at keeping up with the foreign colonial powers who tear up our lands."
  RAJ_industryL:0 "Construct New Factories"
  RAJ_industryL_desc:0 "On top of our expansion of the already existing factories, we should construct far more of them. A project of this magnitude has yet to be done before by any of the great enemies we have collected, they will surely envy us even more after this great project."
  RAJ_idontevenknow:0 "Economic Miracle"
  RAJ_idontevenknow_desc:0 "With our wise subsidies and investments we have managed to cause an economic miracle within our country. The once shambling and weak Marathan economy is now far stronger and booming."
  RAJ_nukes:0 "Nuclear Research"
  RAJ_nukes_desc:0 "Many of our leading scientists have proposed the possibility that a superweapon more powerful than any other bomb could be created with the immense power of nuclear fussion, if such a weapon is feasible we must be the first to create it. All other nations will tremble at our might!"
  RAJ_gandhi:0 "Mahatma Gandhi"
  RAJ_gandhi_desc:0 "Gandhi has a different approach to the other candidates, he doesn't seek militancy and territorial expansion like the others through force - he wants to focus on fixing the internal problems we face and make everyone better as a whole. After all, Malet envisioned a world of peace and not one of war."
  RAJ_ind:0 "180 Day Plan"
  RAJ_ind_desc:0 "One of Gandhi's main promises was a 180 day long plan that would divert resources from the military and general industrial development to act as quick famine relief to at least partly solve the ongoing major famine that some of our most poor areas experience."
  RAJ_famfix:0 "Tackling Famine"
  RAJ_famfix_desc:0 "The 180 Day Plan was a huge success, the large famine a lot of our country suffers from has been reduced to a minimal problem. Of course, it'd be immoral to just leave it at that, it's finally time to stamp our the plague that is famine once and for all in our country!"
  RAJ_ind1:0 "Nationalization"
  RAJ_ind1_desc:0 "It's an unfortunate truth that many of our businesses are run incompetently and as a result inefficiently, severely hurting the potential we have economics wise. By nationalizing various key industries we can hopefully gain some benefits from them having competent leadership."
  RAJ_defend:0 "National Bunkers Program"
  RAJ_defend_desc:0 "Committing to peace puts us at a risk of being surprise attacked, with a campaign that builds defenses in our borders and around the country we will be able to quickly organise a defence if any warmongers try attack us."
  RAJ_delhi:0 "Modernize the Heart of Hindustan"
  RAJ_delhi_desc:0 "Whilst it isn't our capital, Delhi is certainly the Heart of Hindustan - being our largest city as well as having an impact on our culture and being historically prominant as the capital city of many of the old empires that came before us. Delhi is still relatively rural when compared to some of our cities, which is not what you'd imagine the Heart of Hindustan to be like at all."
  RAJ_guajrat:0 "Strengthen the Gujarat Maritime Industry"
  RAJ_guajrat_desc:0 "Gujarat is the best area of our country when it comes to trade income and maritime value, by expanding the maritime industry in Gujarat we can hopefully amplify our trading capabilities too."
  RAJ_gujarat_income:0 "Gujarat Maritime Expansion"
  RAJ_subsidesN_2:0 "Trade Protection"
  RAJ_indore:0 "Develop the Countryside"
  RAJ_indore_desc:0 "In the transition from a rural based economy to an industrial based one we must make sure that the farmers so much of us rely on are fully able to adapt to the rapid changes ahead of us."
  RAJ_popo:0 "Crush Poverty"
  RAJ_popo_desc:0 "Our country exists from the backs of the poor and working class who risen up and overthrow the old corrupt government of the princes in the 1905 Revolution. We can't simply keep going the path we've been heading and abandon our loyalists entirely."
  RAJ_defencecore:0 "Collectivist Spirit"
  RAJ_defencecore_desc:0 "If we get attacked by anybody and our soldiers aren't even willing to fight we'd be fighting a doomed war that'd end in the complete destruction of our regime and a resulting new cloud of darkness over Hindustan, this must be prevented at all costs - the people must be willing to defend the revolution over themselves."
  RAJ_eorissa: "Spread the Revolution East"
  RAJ_eorissa_desc:0 "With the huge prosperity our people now live under it's time to spread our ideals to the countries neighbouring us, the people of Bengal have been long suffering under their corruption oligarchy of a government and with a little encouraging they can have a revolution of their own."
  RAJ_batavia:0 "Seize Dutch India"
  RAJ_batavia_desc:0 "Dutch India has always been a relatively unsuccessful colony for the Dutch, being quickly forced into a losing competition with the Anglo-Scottish Commonwealth we could likely just have them cede it to us if we pressure them with enough force."
  RAJ_scienceboii:0 "University of Delhi"
  RAJ_scienceboii_desc:0 "Built in the centre of the Heart of Hindustan, the planned University of Delhi will be a grandiose building that will educate the people greatly both in the literal and propaganda sense."
  RAJ_election:0 "Emergency Presidential Elections"
  RAJ_uni_of_delhi:0 "University of Delhi"
  RAJ_election_desc:0 "Because of our beloved previous leader's assassination we've been forced into a political deadlock until the next President has been elected by the Marathan Worker's Congress, let's just hope that it ends better for the winner than it did previously."
  unlock_focuses:0 "§RA new Marathan President will be elected.§!"
  RAJ_roy:0 "M.N. Roy"
  RAJ_roy_desc:0 "Roy's stance of moderation will be the most benefitial to us, blatant warmongering only results in a nation's downfall but resorting to pacifism means that we'd lose any opportunities if they arrived."
  RAJ_famfk:0 "Dealing with Famine"
  RAJ_famfk_desc:0 "A priority of ours shall be organizing a large famine relief effort to quickly gain the popular support of the people and move us further towards the ultimate goal of being a global power and the center of the Maletist world."
  RAJ_loan:0 "180 Days of Investment"
  RAJ_loan_desc:0 "The absurd concept of complete nationalization of our economy would only result in disaster for our already precarious situation, instead we shall tactifully invest into key areas to focus on a large industrial build up in a time period of around half a year."
  RAJ_delhill:0 "Rebuild Shaharkeeaasha"
  RAJ_delhill_desc:0 "Our centuries old capital isn't the impressive sight you'd imagine for a self-proclaimed utopian state, a large scale plan has been envisioned by our chief engineers and architects to build Shaharkeeaasha into the greatest city in Asia."
  RAJ_Orissa:0 "Urbanize Orissa"
  RAJ_Orissa_desc:0 "Orissa has a fairly large population but not nearly enough infrastructure to be able to cope with it, by heavily developing the region we can improve the lives of every worker there."
  RAJ_openmarket:0 "Adopt Capitalism"
  RAJ_openmarket_desc:0 "The great writings of Malet must be reinterpreted to fit our needs, the fact we aren't an industrialised society means that to get to the end goal of utopia we need to get the initial requirements first."
  RAJ_opentoforeign:0 "Embrace International Trade"
  RAJ_opentoforeign_desc:0 "Whilst the rest of the world reels at the Great Depression, we were virtually unaffected due to our previous economic stance. Now, we're in a prime position to assert our influence by exploiting the sudden poverty of others."
  RAJ_educatioon:0 "Socialist Education"
  RAJ_educatioon_desc:0 "Heavily investing in our own people's education with our newfound capital will greatly improve the amount of geniuses we can have at our disposal."
