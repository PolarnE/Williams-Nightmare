###PARLIAMENT
USA_congress:1 "Russian Parliament"
USA_congress_desc:1 "The State Duma, known as Russian Parliament was founded in 1905 after the violence and upheaval in the Russian Revolution of 1905 and was Russia's first elected parliament. Made of democratically elected regional governors, is now a legislative body of Russian government - deciding what should be done, what not. High support of the Duma will give us advantages in dealing with internal issues. \n\nPresident Pouplarity represents country-wide support of President's actions. High popularity may lead to good stability and integrity, but will lower the support of the Duma."
