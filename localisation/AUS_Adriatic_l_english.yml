austria.1.t:0 "Death of Franz Ferdinand I"
austria.1.d:0 "Hours ago, Franz Ferdinand I, the Austrian Emperor and Head of the Adriatic Federation passed away.\nHis reign has been one of the most influental in recent Austrian history with the creation of the Adriatic Federation managing to keep the rapidly crumbling Austrian Empire in one piece, many have questioned the Federation's ability to continue past his death though with him being described as the one man holding the state together.\nArchduke Karl I is due to be crowned in the following weeks with the new Emperor being celebrated hugely in the Federation."
austria.1.a:0 "Gott erhalte, Gott beschütze."
austria.2.t:0 "Karl Appoints Hitler as Prime Minister"
austria.2.d:0 "The controversial politician Adolf Hitler has just been appointed the second most powerful position in government by Emperor Karl, this has caused mixed reactions in government - with the Austrian nationalists heavily approving of this decision and saying the main focus of the government should be a huge purge on maletists and republicans; Hitler is reportedly sympathetic to an idea of a purge of this magnitude.\nLeft-wing politicians are horrified by this choice and this has given many of them evidence already that the monarchy is failing and needs to be drastically limited in power or even removed entirely. Extreme concepts like this has fueled even more fighting in parliament with the right-wing often accusing anyone not on the same wing to be a republican and anti-patriotic.\nHitler accepted the post very quickly and later promised that he would bring Austria back to the 'old days of glory' and bring back the old values and strengths of the Austrian Empire before Napoleon the Great's rise to power which caused the downfall of the Empire.\nIf this situation isn't at least partly resolved the Empire may collapse in on itself and fall into a state of civil war."
austria.2.a:0 "He's a hero, let him take his position."
austria.2.b:0 "We can't let Austria fall to the Gosters!"
austria.3.t:0 "Constitutional Crisis"
austria.3.d:0 "The Austrian Parliament blocking Adolf Hitler from becoming Prime Minister has caused a political deadlock in the country, factionalism has gotten worse and everyone is quickly moving to pick a side in the predicted huge conflict that will follow.\nIt quickly looks like Austria is on the brink of a civil war and the Adriatic Federation will completely collapse, only one thing can save Austria and the Federation and that thing is..."
austria.3.a:0 "...Democracy!"
austria.3.b:0 "...Maletism!"
austria.4.t:0 "Ustaše Revolt"
austria.4.d:0 "In response to Hitler ascending to becoming Prime Minister, the Croatian terrorist organisation Ustaša – Croatian Revolutionary Movement, more commonly known as the Ustaše, responded with a flurry of activity. Due to the tough political climate the Federation is currently in attempts to hunt down the Ustaše have been relatively weak and far apart. The Ustaše have managed to raise several divisions worth of soldiers and quickly overwhelmed the city garrison of Zagreb, most of our generals predict that this conflict will be relatively short though due to our numerical superiority and the Ustaše's general lack of professional leadership.\nStill, this is a bad sign of things to come."
austria.4.a:0 "We will crush these impertinent fools."
austria.7.t:0 "Great Depression Hits the Adriatic Federation"
austria.7.d:0 "Ever since the rise of Napoleon the economy has never been a strong point of ours, mere days ago the French vassal the Confederation of the Rhine defaulted all debts to Hungary and this has caused an economic crisis that has completely spiralled out of control into a global financial crisis. It was fairly obvious we were going to be hit by this, but when it finally came it hit really hard - popularity in fascism and maletism has exploded and once peaceful streets have devolved into complete chaos. It will take strong leadership and determination to solve the biggest economic crisis this world has ever seen."
austria.7.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
austria.8.t:0 "Parliament Passes the National Security Act"
austria.8.d:0 "The latest policy proposed by Hitler is an extremely controversial one, called the National Security Act it gives full political control of the Adriatic Federation to GOVP and almost certainly guarantees an end to the parliament institution.\nDue to the larger and larger amount of Gosters in the Parliament they have finally succeeded in passing this controversial reform, Hitler was quick to make a speech about its passing - claim that this is the shining beacon and will guide the Austrians to a new and greater future.\nWith this passing, many prominent anti-fascist politicians are fleeing the country and many experts believe this is only the beginning in Hitler's consolidation of power."
austria.8.a:0 "Lang lebe der Premierminister!"
austria.9.t:0 "Hitler Named Prime Minister for Life"
austria.9.d:0 "In a second act of tyranny, Hitler has taken his goals of cementing political control over the Adriatic Federation further to fruition.\nMere hours ago the rump Parliament has unanimously declared Adolf Hitler the Prime Minister for life - frustratingly enough to the insignificant opposition the last hope of stopping a Goster takeover, Emperor Karl, has refused to comment on the issue of the fracturing institution.\nThis has confirmed to many of these politicians that Emperor Karl is a puppet or possibly even supporter of the radical policies that GOVP proposes."
austria.9.a:0 "Heil Hitler!"
austria.10.t:0 "Hitler's Speech"
austria.10.d:0 "One of the greatest skills Adolf Hitler has as a politician is the ability to make really strong and inspiring speeches, this has driven his political career and served him well.\nHours ago, Hitler made a public speech in Vienna where he was quickly able to captivate the crowd with his awe inspiring promises of restoring Austria to its former glory and unite all Germanic peoples of the world under the single Austrian banner. Whilst to an outsider these radical claims are over the top and neigh impossible, Hitler's strong and flamboyant personality has worked heavily in his favour."
austria.10.a:0 "Nice speech."
austria.11.t:0 "Large Purge of Parliament"
austria.11.d:0 "With near total control of parliament, out of a fit of desperation, the few remaining non-gosterists attempted a poorly-planned coup attempt to 'save the Adriatic Federation.' The plan was discovered quickly due to the concerning increase in surveillance on the population and non-gosterists in Parliament and it has been taken advantage of as proof that people are still out to destroy the glory of Austria. All people complacent or even suspected of involvement with the plan have been trialled and found guilty on all cases for 'terrorism' and 'treason.'\nAlongside these politicians, Hitler has ordered that his old adversaries be purged as well to further strengthen his grip on the nation - other people suspected of harbouring sympathies to stopping GOVP are being trialled as well and are expected to be found guilty."
austria.11.a:0 "It had to be done, for Austria."
austria.12.t:0 "'Austrification' Plan"
austria.12.d:0 "A primary belief of GOVP is that the Austro-German is naturally the greatest of the Germanic peoples and they should be able to dominate all other Germanic races in a 'German Confederation,' which to many sounds like a revival of the Holy Roman Empire. However, first they should restore the Austrian Empire to put the South Slavs back in their place and put the Austro-Germans back on top."
austria.12.a:0 "Ehre sei dem Kaiser!"
austria.13.t:0 "Resettlement of Slovenia"
austria.13.d:0 "Slovenia has been Austrian territory for hundreds of years, and yet their people refuse to accept their subservidence to the superior Austro-German - Hitler has set up a campaign where brave Austro-Germans would be able to become pioneers and take part in the 'Austrification' of Slovenia.\nThese pioneers would be able to take land from the Slovenians and can treat them almost like slave labour, this policy has greatly angered the eternal enemy but that won't stop us."
austria.13.a:0 "Heil Hitler!"
