 ROM_king_carol_ii:0 "Carol II"
 ROM_king_carol_ii_desc:0 "Carol II was officially crowned the King of Romania on the 8th of June, 1930 with the move causing a political deadlock in Romania which nearly escalated to a civil war.\nCarol II is widely regarded to have stolen the throne from Michael and as a result what some politicians have described as a succession crisis is taking place in Romania.\nCarol II is currently the King of Romania but he will have to rally his people behind him by any means possible to win his fight against the state."
 ROM_crown_prince_michael:0 "Crown Prince Michael"
 ROM_crown_prince_michael_desc:0 "Michael is the main pretender behind Carol's reign, most opposition to Carol II describe Michael as the true King of Romania despite the 1935 Constitution saying otherwise.\nMost who rally around Michael see the true authoritarian and despotic way that Carol has reigned and call for his abdication to his own choice or even by force."
 ROM_1935_constitution:0 "Constitution of 1935"
 ROM_1935_constitution_desc:0 "§GCarol II's power is significantly weaker§!.\n\nIn late 1935 Carol II was forced to sign the Constitution of 1935 in an attempt to solve the crisis in the Parliament, the Constitution officially made Carol II the King of Romania but serverely limited his power in the process.\nThe Constitution frequently comes under attack by both Carol and Michael's supporters with Carol's saying that the huge limitation on his power is tyrannical and too radical, whilst Michael's supporters say that Carol II should have been forced to abdicate in the process.\nDespite the frequent attacks on the constitution it has so far done a decent job at holding together the country, but with Carol increasingly desiring to change the Constitution or even possibly suspend it the future is unknowable."
 ROM_revanchist_populace:0 "Revanchist Populace"
 ROM_revanchist_populace_desc:0 "Defeat in the Polish-Romanian War has lead to the politics being dominated by Romanian nationalists and revanchists.\nThe main symbol of Romanian weakness, Bukovina, has seen several attempts by Romanians to try overthrow the Bukovinan government so it gets annexed into Romania which have been unsuccessful and have only resulted in harsher sanctions for Romania.\nAll of this has resulted in Romania rapidly militarising to combat what she sees as enemies on all sides."
 ROM_nationalism_idea:0 "Dream of a Greater Romania"
 ROM_nationalism_idea_desc:0 "Like many other nations in the past, Romania has been attacked and weakened from all sides by countries she could once trust, the goal of the new Romania is to unite all Romanian speaking peoples into a Greater Romania and become the premier balkan state."
 ROM_benevolent_king_idea:0 "Benevolent King Carol"
 ROM_benevolent_king_idea_desc:0 "To improve the legitimacy of Carol II he can be encouraged to go about a campaign of helping the struggling people of Romania and other charitable acts to improve popular support of the King over the Crown Prince. Hopefully this will make Carol II appear more charitable and draw attention away from his many controversies."
 ROM_benevolent_king_idea_2:0 "Benevolent King Carol"
 ROM_benevolent_king_idea_2_desc:0 "To improve the legitimacy of Carol II he can be encouraged to go about a campaign of helping the struggling people of Romania and other charitable acts to improve popular support of the King over the Crown Prince.

 ROM_nationalistic_fervour_desc:0 "Our people know that our country has the potential to dominate the balkans but to achieve this ultimate goal we must get further in touch with our nation to rally behind it properly."

 ROM_support_carolites:0 "Support Carol's Claim"
 ROM_support_carolites_desc:0 "God made Carol II the King of Romania as a sign that he will return the prestige that Romania once had, fending off the now defeated Ottoman Empire under the heroic banner of our great state. Carol's destiny to cause the salvation of Romania makes him the more suitable candidate when compared to the pretender Michael by a long shot."
 ROM_support_michaelites:0 "Support Michael's Claim"
 ROM_support_michaelites_desc:0 "Carol II is an authoritarian playboy who wastes state funds on his own personal ventures, unjustly stealing the throne from young Michael is a step too far. To secure the future of Romanian politics Carol's reign of terror must be stopped in its tracks so Romania doesn't fall to a dictatorship headed by the monarchy."

 ROM_the_benevolent_king_donate_to_charities_desc:0 "Many families struggle to make ends meet in Romania, using the benevolent King's vast wealth he can rapidly donate to these charities as a private individual. When the people see their King's true nature they will undoubtably love him more than the malevolent Michaelites."
 ROM_the_benevolent_king_liquidate_personal_assets:0 "The King's Generosity"
 ROM_the_benevolent_king_liquidate_personal_assets_desc:0 "To many young Romanians Carol II is a symbol of the person you could never achieve, he must bridge this divide between the King and people by giving some of what he has taken from the people's hard work. Carol will still be seen as a playboy but at least he can be seen as more relateable to the people."
 ROM_capitalise_on_revanchism:0 "Capitalise on Revanchism"
 ROM_capitalise_on_revanchism_desc:0 "Romania has been harshly punished within the recent decades and Carol is the only man fit enough for the job of restoring Romania's glory by uniting all Romanian peoples under a single banner, such military feats cannot be sustained by the weaker leader who will only lead to Romania's ultimate downfall."

 ROM_capitalise_on_revanchism_legitimise_iron_guard_desc:0 "More extreme political parties like the Iron Guard are the only people who are able to lead Romania, a democratic government is a sign of weakness as the great King of Romania could make all the decisions for the people as he ultimately knows what's best."
 ROM_the_benevolent_king_the_royal_foundation:0 "The Royal Foundation"
 ROM_the_benevolent_king_the_royal_foundation_desc:0 "The King, out of all the kindness in his heart, has decided to put his money towards a the creation of a new foundation that will be dedicated towards the study of Romanian culture, history and sciences to advance the nation forwards."

 ROM_rally_loyalists:0 "Rally Carolites"
 ROM_rally_loyalists_desc:0 "The Carolites of Romania are vast in number, using our supporters we can influence people who haven't chosen a side or even support Michael into siding with us out of peer pressure. This way simple marches in support of Carol can quickly grow to encompass entire streets, acting as a symbol of Carol's power."
 ROM_rally_loyalists_march_on_bucharest:0 "March on Bucharest"
 ROM_rally_loyalists_march_on_bucharest_desc:0 "By rallying our supporters in Bucharest we can show the sheer power of Carol II over the weak pretender that is Michael.

 ROM_support_carolites_exile_michael_desc:0 "The time has come to rid Michael from Romania entirely, after this is done Carol II will rule over Romania with an iron fist - his decree will be final and as such we will be able to focus on the advancement of Romania's greatness."

 ROM_absolute_monarchy_control_the_iron_guard:0 "Devolve the Iron Guard"
 ROM_absolute_monarchy_control_the_iron_guard_desc:0 "The Iron Guard is no longer necessary to the politics of Romania, they can serve as simple legionnaries but serve no other purpose than this. Codreanu threatens all of our progress to be wiped with his ideas of what the monarchy should be, but Carol sees through this as another attempt to make Romania a constitutional monarchy."
 ROM_iron_guard_codreanu_self_coup:0 "Codreanu's Self-Coup"
 ROM_iron_guard_codreanu_self_coup_desc:0 "To at least pretend our legitimacy in Romania Codreanu has organised a plan to fake a self-coup which will legitimise the popularity of the Iron Guard amongst supporters and give us a viable reason to crack down on the remaining democrats."
 ROM_long_live_the_king:0 "Long Live the King"
 ROM_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "Now that Michael is out of the way we can finally rework Romania to our advantage. Above all else in Romanian society should loyalty to the King stand above anything else as a symbol of pure Romanian strength, wealth and dominance over the various Balkan nations."

 ROM_long_live_the_king_royal_cult_desc:0 "With our full control of the state we can use intensive propaganda to make sure that the only true love within Romania is love for our saviour, Carol II. Heavy propaganda will ensue to brainwash the people into being fully devoted towards fighting to the bitter end for a Greater Romania."
 ROM_long_live_the_king_romanian_legion:0 "Romanian Legion"

 ROM_long_live_the_king_halt_war_reparations:0 "Halt War Reparations"
 ROM_long_live_the_king_halt_war_reparations_desc:0 "The Polish-Romanian War is long over but we're still paying heavy fees towards funding the Polish fools, it's time for us to stand up against these warmongers and defend the Romanian people by no longer giving out money to them. This is likely to hugely hurt the already weak relationship with Poland but this is necessary for our future."
 ROM_long_live_the_king_strengthen_siguranta:0 "Strengthen Siguranta"
 ROM_long_live_the_king_strengthen_siguranta_desc:0 "The Romanian secret police has much to be desired, by drastically expanding its power over the people we can create a truly terrifying force that will crush any form of opposition to the government."
 ROM_long_live_the_king_the_new_roman_emperor:0 "The New Roman Imperator"
 ROM_long_live_the_king_the_new_roman_emperor_desc:0 "King of Romania is a title that does not even describe how great Carol is as our monarch, many of the Iron Guard encourage Carol II to exploit our ancestry in the great Roman Empire by making himself the Imperator of Romania."

 ROM_long_live_the_king_conscript_the_legionnaires_desc:0 "The Romanian military will have the strength of Rome itself if we have enough soldiers who are willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good. These conscripts will form the backbone of the Romanian military and will be useful in restoring Romanian hegemony over the balkans."
 ROM_long_live_the_king_suppress_controversies:0 "Suppress Controversies"
 ROM_long_live_the_king_suppress_controversies_desc:0 "Carol II must be granted a new blank slate from all his past controveries and scandals, with new programs we can ensure that even if the King does something to spark international criticism he will retain his image as the saviour of Romania - a changed man devoted for Romania's future as a country."
 ROM_absolute_monarchy_unite_political_spectrum:0 "Unite the Political Spectrum"
