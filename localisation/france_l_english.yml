 h1936_france.1.t:0 "[RAJ.GetName] annexes Mysore."
 h1936_france.1.d:0 "With the immediate aftermath of the economic collapse, the [RAJ.GetName] has quickly made their moves to 'liberate' the people of India by annexing the Protectorate of Mysore, which only lasted for about half a century, when it was clear that we wouldn't be able to defend it.\nThis is a humiliation we will not forget."
 h1936_france.1.a:0 "The French collapse is apparent."
 h1936_france.2.t:0 "Unrest in the Confederation of the Rhine"
 h1936_france.2.d:0 "The Confederation of the Rhine has exploded in unrest with the recent French collapse, it's not the largest revolt we've ever experienced though and can be quickly put down with the military.\nHowever, if any more issues arrive from our recent collapse then we will be in some grave trouble as the military will be heavily strained in the process."
 h1936_france.2.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
 h1936_france.2.b:0 "They can sort it out themselves."
 FRA_dont_help_rhine_tooltip:0 "§RThis isn't a good idea.§!\n"
 h1936_france.3.t:0 "The Confederation Collapses"
 h1936_france.3.d:0 "Due to our lack of support for the Confederation of the Rhine it has entirely collapsed under pressure from the revolt, leading to their declaration of independence from 'French tyranny.'\nThis has strengthened our enemies a lot, which is another problem for us to add to our list."
 h1936_france.3.a:0 "This is terrible!"
 h1936_france.4.t:0 "Soldiers Strike"
 h1936_france.4.d:0 "The soldiers have taken it upon themselves to disobey the empire, large amounts of soldiers are deserting from their posts to a concerning degree.\nFrance is at her weakest in a century with no military to defend herself, against warmongering enemies and even internal threats."
 h1936_france.4.a:0 "France will outlive this!"
 h1936_france.5.t:0 "Tripoli Revolution"
 h1936_france.5.d:0 "Our holdings in North Africa have been very much damaged by the so called 'French collapse,' with huge revolts breaking out throughout the realm of the Dependency of Marrakech.\nOnly the cruelty of the regime has managed to hold it together, but hours ago this has clearly failed us with a huge revolution in Tripoli, a relatively recent gain for the French Empire which was put under the area of Libya, which driven out the local garrison, huge rebel forces managed to push back the colonial divisions with them only being stopped by the defenses at the borders of Libya and Tunisia.\nThe revolutionaries have made Libya essentially independent under the 'Sultanate of Tripolitania and Fezzan,' with Idris Senussi being made Idris I only a few hours ago. We can let it slide for now, what other choice do we have for now, but lets hope that it doesn't influence the rest of the people under the colonial government."
 h1936_france.5.a:0 "A great shame."
 h1936_france.6.t:0 "Morocco Declares Independence"
 h1936_france.6.d:0 "Shortly after the Tripoli Revolution the people of Morocco clearly taken inspiration and risen up en masse to fight the Dependency of Marrakech, they quickly overran the garrison in Casablanca to seize weapons and ammunition from storages. The rebels quickly moved down to Marrakech, which was heavily guarded as it contained the government which was retreating back to France, the garrison put up a far better fight than the others but they were eventually overran nearly 12 hours later, which was enough time to retreat the government back to France. When the garrison was overwhelmed the Moroccan flag was raised over the city and the Kingdom of Morocco was declared.\nThis has effectively made the Dependency of Marrakech a government in exile and it's clear that we will lose a majority of our African holdings."
 h1936_france.6.a:0 "Someday we will return."
 h1936_france.7.t:0 "De Gaulle's Coup"
 h1936_france.7.d:0 "Using his status as a highly popular hero of the French due to his victories in putting down the rebellions in the Confederation of the Rhine he has rallied a huge amount of Republicans to overthrow the government, which they have done relatively successfully as of now due to the large scale military revolts. With his army he managed to capture almost the entirety of Paris with the Emperor's palace being evacuated.\nIn the palace he declared the second French Republic, but his victories don't seem to amount to much as the Grande Armée is quickly moving to encircle and recapture the city in a siege that is estimated to last for 3 weeks at longest.\nDe Gaulle himself seems to have realised that his victories are hollow as reports have came in that he has fleed the city with nothing confirmed as of now."
 h1936_france.7.a:0 "Such traitors will pay."
 h1936_france.8.t:0 "Recapture of Paris"
 h1936_france.8.d:0 "The people were estatic this morning as the march of the Grande Armée managed to fully recapture Paris and crush the failed French Republic.\nWhile a great boost to French morale in these times of need it has been confirmed that De Gaulle fleed to Tunis so he could avoid standing trial.\nIn Tunis De Gaulle made a speech denouncing our Empire and declaring that the loosely held territories of the Tukulor Empire, Dependency of Marrakech and Colony of French West Africa would be merged into the French Republic in exile.In response to this our diplomats immediately withdrew recognition of this successor state.\nDe Gaulle's actions have acted as a huge morale boost the French people who refuse to see the loss of the Emperor, so despite the new threat in the south this has been a good thing for the Empire."
 h1936_france.8.a:0 "Liberté, Ordre Public."
 h1936_france.9.t:0 "Iberia Withdraws From the Entente Impérial"
 h1936_france.9.d:0 "In the wake of the French Empire's collapse the regency council of the Iberian Confederation has unanimously decided to withdraw the country from the Entente Impérial, this is a serious blow to the Empire as Iberia had a large colonial empire."
 h1936_france.9.a:0 "Traitors!"
 h1936_france.10.t:0 "Tuscany and Naples Withdraw From the Entente Impérial"
 h1936_france.10.d:0 "With De Gaulle's coup and subsequent capture of North Africa the Kings of Tuscany and Naples saw it as a prime opportunity to seek their own path of glory away from French dominated Bonapartist politics."
 h1936_france.10.a:0 "At least we have Italy, right?"
 h1936_france.11.t:0 "Collapse of the Italian Personal Union"
 h1936_france.11.d:0 "The Italian people have clearly had enough of the French government as they overthrown the French loyalist government members and replaced them with Italians, Italo Balbo who was placed as the Regent in case of emergency kept his position as Regent but this time for an independent Kingdom of Italy.\nIt's unknown if Italy will ever look for another monarch, for all we know Italo Balbo may just remain Regent for life. But what we do know is that the unification of Italy is a huge priority of the new government and they'll be working towards it quickly."
 h1936_france.11.a:0 "Defeat after defeat..."
 h1936_france.12.t:0 "End of the Entente Impérial"
 h1936_france.12.d:0 "The last members of the Entente Impérial have officially withdrew from the economic and military alliance, putting an end the long era of French dominance.\nSome day, we will be able to recover what we have lost but today is not that day. Tomorrow is a new day and France will be stronger than the day before, long live the Empire!"
 h1936_france.12.a:0 "Today is not our last day!"
 h1936_france.13.t:0 "End of the French Collapse"
 h1936_france.13.d:0 "The Catalan garrison defended bravely against the Catalan revolt and have finally managed to put an end to the revolt, this has been the largest scale revolt within the Empire as of recently and tensions have died down a lot.\nIt appears that the sun is rising again for France as the problems of mass desertion come to an abrupt halt as order is restored in the Grande Armée, but this doesn't mean that we've recovered from the aftermath of this.\nWe still have a lot of damage control that needs to be done, but the French people are willing to fight more than any other in Europe."
 h1936_france.13.a:0 "We will reclaim our glory!"

 FRA_napoleons_legacy_desc:0 "Napoleon the Great forged the French Empire out of a unstable and weak republic, his conquests have shaped the modern world with him going down as one of the most controversial figures in history.\nIn death, Napoleon is more powerful than he was in life with propaganda around him dominating France."
