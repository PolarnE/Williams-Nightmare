 h1936_france.2.t:0 "Mysore Crisis"
 h1936_france.2.d:0 "In an alarming turn of events, the Protectorate of Mysore has informed us that the Marathan Socialist People's Republic has demanded that they form a union with eachother. Many people of our government approve of supporting the Protectorate of Mysore to show French strength in this time of weakness, but what's the point of holding onto a liability in the time of crisis?"
 h1936_france.2.a:0 "Back Mysore."
 h1936_france.2.b:0 "Leave them to their own fate."
 h1936_france.4.t:0 "Catalonia Declares Independence"
 h1936_france.4.d:0 "The French hegemony in western Europe has been declining ever since Napoleon I's death, with some of our subjects being virtually independent from French rule, but the biggest blow to the Empire in its history has just arrived. With the French economy completely in tatters the rebellious Catalans have taken it upon themselves to try establish their own country once again - banking on the belief that because of our dire state we might not even do anything to put down these rebels.\nThey're correct that we have other problems, but putting down this revolt is a large one in itself, without a doubt we could easily crush Catalonia but some members of government have proposed that we try negotiate with the Catalans to work towards ending their revolutionary fervour once and for all."
 h1936_france.4.a:0 "Crush them."
 h1936_france.4.b:0 "We can work something out here."
 h1936_france.5.t:0 "Catalonia Defeated"
 h1936_france.5.d:0 "Like predicted, we have quickly triumped over the Catalonian Revolution with minimal problems and are currently reasserting French control of the region. Sadly, a majority of the leaders in this revolution have fled or suicided to evade capture and trial - but this rebellion being crushed still proves that France is a great power and force to be reckoned with despite the current setbacks."
 h1936_france.5.a:0 "Vive l'Empire!"
 catalonia.1.t:0 "France Offers us Grand Duchy Status" #This is rn all of Catalonia's content so making a new file would be silly
 catalonia.1.d:0 "Like we hoped the French military is too busy putting down other rebellions to be able to launch a full invasion of Catalonia, so instead of taking the militaristic approach the French have offered us concessions if we return back to them. They're proposing that we get elevated to the status of Grand Duchy within the French Empire and we have the ability to make laws for ourselves with little to no French interference.\nOur nation is small and weak in an impoverished world, so the prospects of an independent Catalonia aren't great - which leads many of our government to see the merits of this proposal."
 catalonia.1.a:0 "They've got a deal."
 catalonia.1.b:0 "We demand more than that!"
 h1936_france.6.t:0 "Catalonia Accepts Grand Duchy Status"
 h1936_france.6.d:0 "After furious debate the Catalan government has accepted our proposal of becoming a Grand Duchy under a personal union with France, saying that preparations will be made for Emperor Louis-Napoléon's coronation as Grand Duke of Catalonia."
 h1936_france.6.a:0 "A great day!"
 h1936_france.7.t:0 "Coronation of Louis II of Catalonia"
 h1936_france.7.d:0 "After a year of preparing the grand coronation ceremony of our Emperor Louis-Napoléon as Grand Duke of Catalonia, they have finally announced that it's time for the coronation to begin. Taking place in the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya. It was a celebration of impressive scale, with Catalan soldiers doing long marches set to the Catalan anthem Els Segadors and the French anthem Chant du Départ - culminating with a grand parade around the streets of Barcelona.\nEmperor Louis-Napoléon announced that he would be taking the name Louis II of Catalonia as a symbolic reference to the French king Louis XIII being crowned Louis I of Catalonia during the Reapers' War.\nAt the end of it all, the Catalan government officially accepted their status as a French realm once again - ending these long standing tensions and turning a new page in Catalonia's history."
 h1936_france.7.a:0 "Vive la Catalogne!"
 h1936_france.8.t:0 "Catalonia Refuses"
 h1936_france.8.d:0 "Catalonia has refused our offer of becoming a Grand Duchy within the French realm, saying that it doesn't meet the conditions that they see as necessary for continued Franco-Catalan co-operation. However, they've refused to tell us what these conditions are, so we're forced to just make a guess here and offer them financial compensation alongside the status of Grand Duchy. Alternatively, we can just invade them."
 h1936_france.8.a:0 "Enough talk! We will crush these rebels!"
 h1936_france.8.b:0 "Offer them economic concessions too."
 catalonia.2.t:0 "France Sweetens the Deal"
 catalonia.2.d:0 "The French Empire has come to us with what they say is their final offer, they give us economic concessions which will act as a great boon to our industry on top of the already established offer of Grand Duchy status. Going for more now will almost certainly result in a war with France, which we have no hopes in winning, but are we really going to sell ourselves to the frogs?"
 catalonia.2.a:0 "This is acceptable."
 catalonia.2.b:0 "We won't surrender to the French!"
 h1936_france.9.t:0 "Catalonia Yields"
 h1936_france.9.d:0 "Catalonia has finally decided to agree to becoming a Grand Duchy after we offered them financial concessions to keep their regime afloat - whilst this didn't go as smoothly as we'd have hoped it was in the end a successful result for us. Let's just hope everything else goes better than this did."
 h1936_france.9.a:0 "Not bad, not good either."
 h1936_france.10.t:0 "Negotations Break Down"
 h1936_france.10.d:0 "Negotations with the Catalan menace have failed entirely, with them refusing our good will and nature in becoming a vassal state. It looks like we will have to do the military option in this situation."
 h1936_france.10.a:0 "The Catalan experiment has failed."
 tunisia.1.t:0 "French Withdrawal From Tunisia"
 tunisia.1.d:0 "With the French military in shambles and busy putting down revolts in Europe, they've been forced to withdraw their armies from Tunisia, this provides us with the opportunity of receiving the freedom we've always deserved."
 tunisia.1.a:0 "A new page in Tunisia's history."
 tunisia.1.b:0 "We'd be nothing without France."
 libya.1.t:0 "French Withdrawal From Tripoli"

 libya.1.b:0 "We'd be nothing without France."
 h1936_france.11.t:0 "Crisis in North Africa"
 h1936_france.11.d:0 "Because of our military being in a rather lethargic and fragile state at the moment, and the numerous rebellions were facing we were forced to withdraw a majority of our men from Tunisia and Tripolitiania - despite knowing the risks. Only days after that decision was made the two protectorates have decided to betray us and sent their small militaries to capture or even massacre the small garrisons in their major cities, and then issued a declaration of independence from us.\nThis has put all the spotlight on North Africa and it's clear that we will need to ensure loyalty within the people of Marrakech-Algiers and Mauritania."
 h1936_france.11.a:0 "Lets review this situation..."
 h1936_france.12.t:0 "Situation in Marrakech-Algiers"
 h1936_france.12.d:0 "Due to the fact Marrakech-Algiers' economy is nearly self-sufficient in some departments, they weren't hit as hard economically by the Great Depression as much as our other colonies were. However, because of the recent rebellions we've been forced to direct less military forces in the area which has caused the natives to get more and more insubordinate and rowdy, the colonial administration of Marrakech-Algiers sees an upcoming rebellion occuring soon and have requested that we send them military aid to assert control over the natives."
 h1936_france.12.a:0 "They just need men to put this down."
 h1936_france.12.b:0 "Send Marshal Pétain and some men to take control." 
 h1936_france.12.c:0 "Dissolve Marrakech-Algiers and establish direct rule."
 h1936_france.12.f:0 "Dissolve Marrakech-Algiers and establish protectorates in its place."
 h1936_france.12.e:0 "Don't do anything."
 h1936_france.13.t:0 "Situation in Mauritania"
 h1936_france.13.d:0 "Mauritania has existed in an age of prosperity ever since Éboué was put in charge of it, having many of the supposedly oppressive policies of the previous administration ended and turning the colony less into a possible settlement and more into one that just exports raw resources back to the homeland. Mauritania has almost certainly seen success under Éboué but much like Marrakech-Algiers it has fallen to unrest and strife, to the extent where he is requesting that we send aid to the colony to avoid a potential war of independence.\nThis claim does seem reasonable enough, as the streets of Ville Louis-Napoléon contain hundreds or maybe even thousands of natives protesting. But, many people in our government have started suspecting Éboué, noting that he's naturally suspicious and could be in fact trying to incite rebellion to destroy the French Empire, and whilst France is obviously above the imperialistic ideas of racism they do make a reasonable point. Éboué himself has pledged his loyalty to the Emperor several times but that didn't do much to save face."
 h1936_france.13.a:0 "Send soldiers so he can take care of it himself."
 h1936_france.13.b:0 "Recall Éboué and send Huntziger to take charge."
 h1936_france.13.c:0 "Send Huntziger to aid Éboué in putting down this rebellion."
 h1936_france.13.e:0 "Don't do anything."

 FRA_Stagnant_Beast_desc:0 "The French Empire carved out by Emperor Napoleon and maintained by his successors is certainly one of the largest and most powerful empires in world history. However, following the Great War, overstretched armies and underperforming economies has led to a great stagnation in the Empire.
