 baltic_partition.1.t:0 "France Withdraws from the Baltics"
 baltic_partition.1.d:0 "After two decades of occupation the French have been forced to withdraw from their little puppet, the United Baltic Republic, due to their military entering complete chaos. This has given us a great opportunity to finally rid the world of the illegal Baltic state, however, we aren't the only hawks that prey on them - Prussia and Sweden also eye them up as they both too have claims to Baltic territories that they would love to take back for themselves.\nPresident Davidovich has came up with the plan of holding a territorial conference with Prussia and Sweden to partition the stolen Baltic territories and then collaborate on a military invasion to enforce these demands - in the process having relations improved between all 3 powers and strengthening the Russian position in the Baltic Sea."
 baltic_partition.1.a:0 "Invite the Prussians and Swedes!"
 baltic_partition.1.b:0 "This only proves Davidovich is a warmonger!"
 baltic_partition.2.t:0 "Russian Invitation to Minsk"
 baltic_partition.2.d:0 "Lev Davidovich has devised a plan to partition the illegal Baltic state between us two and Prussia, saying that this will 'correct the wrongs imposed on us powers by the treaties of the Great War' and inspire friendlier relations between the 3 countries.\nWe seek nothing but to gain from this prospect so joining Russia, as much as it pains us, is the natural option here."
 baltic_partition.2.a:0 "We will attend."
 baltic_partition.3.t:0 "Sweden Agrees"
 baltic_partition.3.d:0 "After a short debate in the Swedish parliament, they have agreed to join this territorial conference - citing that they agree on the same general ideas that President Davidovich has suggested of this conference and are willing to do short-term co-operation to deal with a long standing mutual threat."
 baltic_partition.3.a:0 "Great news!"
 baltic_partition.4.t:0 "Russian Invitation to Minsk"
 baltic_partition.4.d:0 "Lev Davidovich has devised a plan to partition the illegal Baltic state between us two and Sweden, saying that this will 'correct the wrongs imposed on us by powers by the treaties of the Great War' and inspire friendlier relations between the 3 countries.\nAs Russia's old ally from the Great War we can easily honour this call and expect a good deal to come out of it, even if we were allies with the old Empire we can still place our trust in the Russians."
 baltic_partition.4.a:0 "We will attend."
 baltic_partition.5.t:0 "Prussia Agrees"
 baltic_partition.5.d:0 "The President of Prussia, Erwin Rommel has sent an official response to our proposal saying that he sees the idea as acceptable and he will be willing to attend it - saying that he does agree that our relations could only benefit and it will finally rid this world of the Baltic traitors, giving himself a boost in popularity in the process."
