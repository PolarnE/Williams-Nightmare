 confedrhine.1.d:0 "Ever since the Great War, Hungary has had serious financial issues and having several hits of economic depression that is usually contained within their own borders.\nToday, however, the Hungarians have demanded that we pay back all of our loans to them in full and immediately - this is something we couldn't do, especially since we've been struggling financially ourselves as of late.\nBoth options aren't great, the financial consequences of defaulting Hungary are predicted to be alarming and could even destroy what economy we have left, but we have little choice in the matter."
 confedrhine.1.a:0 "Default our debts to Hungary."

 newsWN.3.desc:0 "The declining French economy has hit its peak, stocks have plunged in Paris from the panicking market and have caused economic collapse. The Confederation of the Rhine defaulting on Hungary's debts has caused the greatest global depression in centuries.\nThe crash is making its effect toll around the planet, as most nations had heavy trade with France it has caused their economies to also plummet with factories closing down in the hundreds around the world. With this economic collapse global support for Maletism, a previously unpopular ideology with only a hold on previously poor countries has seen growth skyrocket with many governments worrying if it will affect them.\nMany ask if this is the end of Napoleon's empire..."

 newsWN.9.t:0 "The Confederation of the Rhine Defaults Debts to Hungary"
 newsWN.9.desc:0 "\nDue to their weak economy and recent recession, the Hungarian government is known for pouncing on opportunities like this and only a few hours ago they demanded that the Confederation of the Rhine immediately paid back all debts owed to the Hungarian Federal Republic despite uncertainty about the Confederation's ability to even pay the debts in the first place.\nMost economists have heavily criticised Hungary's move as, predictably enough, the Confederation was unable to pay back these debts and were forced to default all debt owed to Hungary. This has caused a huge recession in both country's economies and it's a major concern that it could spread out of the two countries and cause a global financial depression."
 newsWN.9.a:0 "This will blow over." #you fucking idiots!!!
 h1936_france.1.t:0 "Stocks Plummet"
 h1936_france.1.d:0 "In line with the belief of a lot of economists, the recession from the Confederation of the Rhine has spread to France due to their reliance on us. Stocks have plummeted and the only possible outcome of this is a global depression that everyone was so worried about, never before has the French Empire had to deal with a crisis like this before, but it is sure to leave a mark on the history books forever."
 h1936_france.1.a:0 "This couldn't get worse."
 siam.1.t:0 "The Great Depression Hits Siam"
 siam.1.d:0 "Our economy is very closely tied with that of France, so the collapse of their economy is anything but good news. We've quickly seen a huge recession in finances and it's pretty clear we can't pay the French our tribute anymore, we just hope they will take pity on us and understand the situation and what's at stake here."
 siam.1.a:0 "Stop paying tribute to France."
 h1936_france.3.t:0 "Siam Stops Paying Tribute"
 h1936_france.3.d:0 "Ever since the great Paris Confederation the Siamese have been paying us tribute on the condition that we protect them from any foreign threats, most prominantly the Commonwealth. However, due to the Great Depression the small Kingdom finds its coffers dry and is completely unable to pay their tributes - a lot of people see this as an outrage as it means that we don't get our end of the deal. Prominant figures have defended the Siamese however, saying that they're simply trying to cope in this time of need for us all and the worst thing for them would be if we cut all ties."
 h1936_france.3.a:0 "They lose their end of the deal."
 h1936_france.3.b:0 "They're just trying to cope."
 siam.2.t:0 "France Revokes Protection"
 siam.2.d:0 "Our fears have come into fruition, France has completely withdrew from any treaty which makes them guarantee our independence. Siam is now a lone wolf and must contend with her biggest crisis in decades alone."
 siam.2.a:0 "Siam is surrounded by enemies."
 siam.3.t:0 "France Takes Pity"
 siam.3.d:0 "The French government, after long debate, have decided to not revoke protection on our nation - sourcing that our decision was forced by the global economic crisis and there wasn't anything we could've done about it."
 siam.3.a:0 "Great news!"
