 confedrhine.1.d:0 "Ever since the Great War, Hungary has had serious financial issues and having several hits of economic depression that is usually contained within their own borders.\nToday, however, the Hungarians have demanded that we pay back all of our loans to them in full and immediately - this is something we couldn't do, especially since we've been struggling financially ourselves as of late.\nBoth options aren't great, the financial consequences of defaulting Hungary are predicted to be alarming and could even destroy what economy we have left, but we have little choice in the matter."

 newsWN.9.t:0 "The Confederation of the Rhine Defaults Debts to Hungary"
 newsWN.9.desc:0 "\nDue to their weak economy and recent recession, the Hungarian government is known for pouncing on opportunities like this and only a few hours ago they demanded that the Confederation of the Rhine immediately paid back all debts owed to the Hungarian Federal Republic despite uncertainty about the Confederation's ability to even pay the debts in the first place.\nMost economists have heavily criticised Hungary's move as, predictably enough, the Confederation was unable to pay back these debts and were forced to default all debt owed to Hungary. This has caused a huge recession in both country's economies and it's a major concern that it could spread out of the two countries and cause a global financial depression."

 h1936_france.1.d:0 "In line with the belief of a lot of economists, the recession from the Confederation of the Rhine has spread to France due to their reliance on us. Stocks have plummeted and the only possible outcome of this is a global depression that everyone was so worried about, never before has the French Empire had to deal with a crisis like this before, but it is sure to leave a mark on the history books forever."
